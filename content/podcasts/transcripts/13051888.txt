Welcome to Behind the Ticker.
Today we have David Cohen.
He runs the Handles Index.
He is an industry veteran.
He has been in the industry for a very, very long time.
Primarily building and creating strategies that can be utilized in ETFs.
And the Handles Index is behind the ETF HNDL.
It's a very successfully ETF, but I could have talked to David for hours.
We talked a little bit after the show as well.
A wealth of knowledge.
You're definitely going to want to listen to this episode with David Cohen.
David, welcome to the show.
Thanks, Brad.
So you run the Handles Indexes.
Before we get into that, can you tell me about your background and how you got into the position you
are today?
Sure, I'd love to.
So I came out of the Chicago ETF and mutual fund business that kind of was this West Wing of
in Chicago and the Western suburbs.
And a lot of that came out of a company called Niveen that did a lot of stuff in the early 2000s
and tried to get into the ETF business and backtracked and went away.
And things like Power Shares, a guy like Bruce Bond who created Power Shares,
worked with Hannah Dave Hooten, who created Claymore, Claymore ETFs, which later became
Google and I'm ETFs, and I worked in the...
I worked for David and Claymore and we created Claymore ETFs back in the day.
And Christian McGoon, who's an amplifier.
A lot of people, a lot of the...
It was quite a center of the ETF universe out in the Western suburbs of Chicago.
So I came from there and we developed a lot of innovative products that Claymore back in the
day and we were early to the... to the game.
We did the first brick ETF back in, it was 2000 and so 2003, our six, 2006, I think it was.
We did a lot of first-first-to-market concepts and that was things we focused on and we brought
the first multi-acet, a multi-acet product, which was called the yield hog back in.
It did a lot of interesting products and went through that.
And so there I met my partner, Matt Patterson, who came with a couple of other gentlemen
created a concept called Bullet Shares Indexes and Bullet Shares became an enormous successful product,
and it really addressed the bond market and made bonds ETFs into act-like bonds, not like bond fund.
And so from there we kind of learned that ETFs have to have kind of a purpose and we focused on that.
And that's where handles kind of came.
So you ran around with the originals of the ETF industry.
It sounds like, I mean, you've been in the game for a very long time.
Uh, there's so many people who are in this business in a long time.
I mean, yeah, I was, I rang the Belty American Stock Exchange a few times.
Yeah, so yeah, so a lot of us did.
And there are a lot of people out there and a lot of us are still, you know, in the game.
A lot of the innovation you're seeing is coming from from those people.
And then the people I worked with in those times, yes.
So yeah, it was a pretty dynamic business, a long time ago and of it's grown up quite fast.
Yeah, so what about personally, what do you like to do when you're not working,
what are some of your hobbies and things you like to do?
Uh, I've taken up, you know, as I was telling you before we started the, uh,
we recently kind of bought a little gentleman's farm in the middle of, uh,
in the middle of Long Island and we're redoing that and we're kind of,
we're raising, uh, we're raising birds and animals and things and rescue and, uh, cats and dogs and things.
It's, it's a kind of a, it's a very peaceful existence.
A little bit more relaxed than, than working on a monster.
Yeah, well, it's funny you say, you know, birds, my, uh, my mother-in-law, uh, two weeks ago,
a baby crow fell out of a nest and now she's raising it.
I'm like, are you sure you, you can raise a crow and things still come together?
Yeah, I don't go rescue any birds out in the middle of the wilderness.
It's certainly not close.
Yeah, exactly.
That's what my son said, you're doing this.
We have some, there are some crazy crowds, but like, you know, we have, it's just, it's, um,
you know, more like, uh, long Island has a lot of ferrocats that get, you know, rehosted,
re-house and things like that, so the alphorecatic sheep's and so it's, it's a nice,
it's a nice way to kind of get in touch with me.
Sure, that's great. Good for you.
So let's pivot a little bit to handles.
So how did the indexes come about and were you running strategies or were you running money on
these strategies before they came indexes?
Like, can you talk about the story of how this, how this, how this came about?
To be clear, my partner Matt and I come from the product development side.
He's a securities lawyer.
I, you know, worked in product development and came up with new ideas and concepts and new ways
about how the powder bring.
And a lot of what we did back in the Claymore days was closed in funds.
And we came out of the closed-end fund market.
And handles was really, you know, in closed-end fund markets, it's an interesting nuance
part of the business where, you know, a big company like BlackRock or an eating vans or whatever,
we'll bring a fund to market market and syndicate it through advisors and they'll distribute it.
And then they manage the money and they believe that, in fact, they have the money and perpetuity
they provide. Essentially, most of them are leveraged income strategies or a large portion of the
and from that has, you know, what was, there was a derivative market was more and packaging up
the secondary closed-end fund market and reselling those to a investor, right?
So that's where we came from. That was kind of our market. That's one of the areas we focused on.
And so, as we did that, we went forward, we saw, okay, there's a real transition going on
in the marketplace. And that transition is that people are going to retire 10,000 people like that.
You cannot miss where the salmon are going. They are going upstream, they need the retiring,
they need income. And we had zero percent interest rates, interest rates were really well.
There was nothing in the marketplace. And we said, okay, close-end funds have been a fantastic
way for people to do leveraged income strategy. And packaging them has been very successful.
Can we do it more efficiently through an open-end vehicle like an ETF? And that was essentially
the concept behind hand was to essentially make a beta play of these package products of
closed-end funds that were used to drive income strategy.
But that's interesting. So we didn't run the money. We were not portfolio managers.
We are not portfolio managers now. We created indexes. And there's a reason why we created it.
Yeah, so you're supposed to talk about, yeah, I'm sorry.
Can you talk a little bit about the strategy behind handles and how it operates?
Yeah, I'll be out of the time. And let me just go back to what I was saying,
just finish what I was saying, or which was, there's a reason why we like indexes. And that's
because indexes have rules. And rules can't, and they don't change, they don't deviate.
There is an argument in the world for active management for your product, your THL, which I
love, fantastic fun, very well thought out, nicely done. And there is a room for that in the market.
There's a place for that. There are also people who are, you know, true believers in passive
strategies, things like the S&P 500, or just buying, you know, buy the market and they're
there's room for things in between. And handles tries to be in between, right? It's kind of in the
middle. And the strategy is based on the fact that sometimes, you know, the passive are right,
and sometimes the actions are right, okay? And so there's two songs. And so one side is we call the
core and one side we call the explorer. The explorer, the core is 70, 30, fixed income equity, okay?
All the time. Rebalance is every month. The explorer side is made up of a handful of different
income-based strategies that Dorsey write uses their algorithms to wait and select. And the
marketplace based off of a factor that has a proven, the proof, one of the proven factors in
active management, which is moment, right? They're very good at it. So it plays off the two of those.
But both of them are kind of in the same pinwheels, so to say, in terms of asset allocations. And
so you can vary a little bit. There's a little bit of deviation. But the truth is,
sometimes passive wins, sometimes active wins. We want to be somewhere in the middle. Because
what we're trying to do is focus on total return. And not really focus on the components of total
return, which are yield and price appreciation, okay? Those two things are kind of inter- they don't
mean as much as the aggregate number, which is total return. It's the only number that really
me. And so handles is like, let's create a high risk adjusted return product or fund or
not fund, but an index. So to say, portfolio. And how to use that to deliver an income strategy
because it's based in an ETF. And it's actually funny. We were working on this idea called
Stactical, which would combine, you know, static holdings like the SPY and some other things
with tactical. Very similar to what you do. It wasn't a yield play. But it was more of a
more of a take on when there's times where you should be strategic, there's times where you should
be tactical. And, you know, how do you find when that time period is, which is, you know,
very hard thing to do, but it's something we've been working on. So it's really hard,
you're right. And it's really hard to do that, not only to do that, but to do that and create
something that people invest in a timely manner, because there's so much of the effect on going
into something when it feels good, which is usually not the time you should go into something. But in
fact, you should go into it when it doesn't feel good. And investors do the same things when they
go in and out of our products and the funds and things that they buys, is some things are designed
to be long-term holdings and they're designed to look over the long-term and smooth performance
over a long time. And when you trade, you're actually working against yourself, because you can be
right, you can be wrong, or you can be, you know, dead. And it's like, okay, not to make a change.
And see if you're right, make sure you're right, because trading's expensive.
Yeah, yeah, I was, I found that out early when I thought day trading was, was fun and
too blow, but a counter to in college and then you're like, all right, let's find a way to be
invested more often than not. But back to back to handle. So handles seven is an index that runs
in ETF with a ticker H and D L. We talk about that strategy in particular, because that's,
there's over a billion dollars in that ETF. Yes, that's correct. It is, it was our first ETF.
And it's really, the idea behind handles is we don't fancy ourselves to be stockpickers or things
of that nature. It's just not our, that's not what we do, that's not what we're saying. We look
at the market. And if you look at markets, you know, Harry Mark, who's a father modern portfolio
theory, basically, showed that diversification is the only free-launch in investment. And so we are
looking, what we were looking to do when we created this index that is tracked by the H and D L ETF
is to have a very diversified portfolio. So, you know, we used other ETFs, which gives us,
you know, an S in somewhere in the neighborhood of exposure to 20,000 individual securities.
I think we counted up one day. We were sitting around and saying, okay, how many are we,
and we added them up? And it looked like about 20,000 when we did ran the spreadsheet.
And that's, that's way more diversification than diversification needs. So, we've answered that
prof. And, and so the, again, the idea was how to create a good risk adjusted portfolio.
And so, when we did that, we, we looked historically at what were the best,
what was the best allocation over time. Over, over the last 50, 60, 70 years. What allocation
for providing you the highest risk adjusted returns? Because sharp ratio is all of matters. We,
way all understand that. That's the ride that you go on investing. When you, when you, when you,
what the, the data point at the end of the year, if what the S and P did or what a stocked
did or what something did is, is the total return. But the ride is the volatility. And the volatility
is risk and risk adjusted returns. You want the smoothest ride you can. And so, we looked
historically, and it was 70% fixed and come 30% equity, which people can argue, okay, well,
it was a great bond mark, you know, in the last 50, 60. Okay, well, things are cyclical. We don't
know what the next 50 or 60 years are going to look like either. So, but we do know over the last 50
years or so, 70, 30 had, let's say, about the best risk adjusted. So, that was the, the target
kind of allocation within the portfolio. Now, what modern portfolio theory tells you is, is that
you just leverage or de-leverage the optimal portfolio. Because there is no difference in the
optimal portfolio, whether it's an income portfolio or regular portfolio. You, you just leverage
or de-leverage to increase to the risk level that you as an investor prefer. And so, to get to where
we thought we could deliver 70% over a period of time and through an index, what we needed to do
was say, okay, you needed to have some form of leverage and that in a bit of order to do that.
And that's another function that we learned from closed. And that's another advantage that an
ETF can bring, you know, because the ETF brings a lot of really good advantages to investors. Number
one, they're incredibly efficient. So, the trading is very efficient. The real allocation is incredibly
efficient. You know, for an investor to run a portfolio and reallocate it on a monthly basis,
it's very expensive and very time consuming and very complicated. But it's a very beneficial thing
that portfolio management, there's due bring to the table. And then handle does another thing,
which is essentially through the index it allocates a portion equal to 1, 12th of 7% or whatever
the number is the 7 number on a monthly basis to for distribution. It takes it out because the idea
of buying yield or chasing yield is what gets most investors in Trump. And so, we just said, let's
start with the yield number and deliver the optimal portfolio and adjust the risk level to create the
index that's going to deliver that. That's the concept. That's the strategy behind what we did.
And we think it makes sense and it hasn't done 7% every year, certainly didn't last year,
but I challenged you to find anything that did or can't. There's nothing much you can do.
It is a passive strategy. It is the market. But for the last five years, it's done, you know,
the index is as delivered. It's done pretty well. And again, that idea that total return
is really the important thing in the yield is just a number. One of the things I like to illustrate
or look back at is AT&T and the stock of AT&T. And if you look at that since over the last decade
or so or even 20 years, and it has people buying because it's a yield stock. But, you know, the total return
hasn't been particularly good. In fact, you know, and they've just been returning your money to you over a period of time
diluting. That's what. So it's not that's not to pick on AT&T. That's just to pick on chasing yield as a
strap. You said a lot of interesting things there that I want to touch based on and ask some follow-up.
So how does the leverage component work? I understand what you're doing in terms of leveraging
and delivering, but this is a rules-based index. So what triggers a leveraging event and what
triggers a dealething event? There is no triggering on the lever. The number, the number of the
handle triggers the leverage. The five handle is the base index. It's on level. The seven handle is
levered at one point. It's 23% a leverage, essentially because it's a 1.3x version. And then the
10 handle is 2x. So that's 2 times less. So the number is work proportionally. It's mostly just
math. The whole thing's gone. Got it. That makes sense. Now the distribution or the yield side.
So I read somewhere that there could be a more favorable tax treatment with the type of distribution
that you're doing. I read that somewhere on the website. I'm sure that's very situational,
but could you explain that or how the distribution works? Well, the way the distribution, and again,
return a capital, just in general, is in a count. It's a measurement of a counting term,
a counting. Again, this is something else we learned from the closed end fund industry, which
is being able to distribute, treating things as a return a capital. MLPs have done this for years.
It's a way of passing back or returning your principle. This has happened to be a side effect
of ETFs that I think a lot of people maybe are overlooking, which is an ETF can basically,
because of the way the rebalancing aspect works, you can shift your long-term capital gains.
You don't have to recognize them. You defer to them, right? That's why investors buy ETFs
because their capital gains are deferred to the future, right? One of the positive things
that you're not getting in capital gains. You're not going to tax on manual basis.
It's up to you to decide when you sell. Because it's a total return strategy and you're looking
at trying to deliver that return, whether it be through dividends or through capital gains,
there's an ability to essentially defer capital gains to future, and it becomes retreated,
treated as a return of capital. Some of the dividend is not even an up tax that the end of the year.
It's something that a lot of people think might be, that I think with a lot of people treated as
being a negative, and it's not a negative. It's actually not bad at all, because returning,
if you experience a capital gain and you earn the income, you deliver the distribution,
you receive the distribution, then in fact, and you're not taxed on it, you defer it off into
the future. You can defer it to a later date, and even potentially to when your state settles
at some point in time, you have a step-up of cost basis. So, the speed at which you return a
capital can be a problem, if some things, there's some things out there that are delivering,
return a capital very quickly, but minor amounts of return a capital are just attractive from
tax perspective. Got it. Thanks for that. I was trying to dig through the perspective,
stand out a little bit, but that was thanks for clarifying that.
Yeah. So, I think it's the issue of return a capital, it's very individual, but it's also not a
scarce scary as people think it should be. It's really, it's, again, total returns what map.
If your fund is making, if you're fund, whatever fund or your index, whatever it is that you're
looking at is earning more than you're distributing, then you are doing, well, if you're not,
it doesn't matter how they trade it from a tax perspective. It doesn't make any difference.
So, you briefly touched on the explore side of the portfolio, which is run by a Dorsey Wright.
Is that a go anywhere, sleeve, or is there certain parameters of how that explore portfolio
work? No, the, the, the, the different categories of the explore portfolio that were chosen,
which include, but there, there areas that people income investors tend to like to invest.
So, there's things in there like high yield bond. There's investment grade corporates.
There's a, a, build America bonds, which are taxable meanings. There are, uh, covered call funds,
uh, you know, Jepi is, is, is in there. There's a growth and income fund.
Um, so there's different things that people like to invest in. The part of having Dorsey Wright
select them is that it's based on momentum within the market, which has actually been pretty good,
because they ever waited like MLPs in the last, you know, the last year. Who called that?
You know, it was good, it was good, it was good, it was good, it was good.
Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. In the end of the time,
day, it adds value to the, you know, total, it's over time.
Yeah, I mean, over, with any, you know, taxable strategy you hope would,
you know, over three and five year cycle periods are delivering close to the benchmark with a
smoother return and better sharp as you put it, uh, and if they're doing that, then, you know,
that's, that's all you can ask for. So you briefly touched on this as well, as far as a
rebalance period. So you re, you rebalance the strategic side, as you said, on a monthly basis,
does the infrastructure, so that's a rebalance. Okay. So that's a rebalance within your
buckets, and then also a rebalance of the buckets. Yeah. Yes. Okay. What's on a change in the
constituents change on a net once a year, but and the, and the constituents election process is
really only geared towards, you know, finding the least cost representatives of each of the
areas. It's, it's not overly robust in the selection process, but it did lead to some good
fine, some good funds that, you know, in the end of that process, we went full good. Yeah. So if you're
sitting down with someone talking about the handle suite, where do you see this fitting inside
and overall model portfolio, and can it be just a standalone strategy of one size fits all?
Well, I mean, theoretically, it's like the market. It's basically representative of the market.
It's a 70% fixed income, a 30% equity strategy, because it's the most of the market representation.
That's, you know, but, but portfolios are per personal. They're not, they're not one size fits all.
But the product or the concept, the handles concept was designed to deliver a high level of
current income. I mean, it's basically designed to give you high income. That's it. That's what it's,
if you're, if you want to depend on something delivering you income, because it's defined by rules,
these are the rules. It delivers one 12th of what, you know, one 12th of 7% of a monthly basis back to you,
and uses the ETF structure to rebalance and recalibrate, make sure everything's perfect on a monthly
basis, and make sure you get your, you know, your check is delivered on the, on the, on the day,
you know, whatever it's supposed to be delivered. This is how it works. These are the rules that are,
if all alternatively, people can choose to go and chase yield. That invariably tends to end
poorly when you chase the highest yielding items. This is really a benchmark for what I,
I think it's a benchmark for what a 7% return should look like or 7% yield should look like in the
marketplace, and people can go, they can find something they like better or find something when
they're like worse. I think they'll be hard pressed to find things on a risky just the basis
that deliver better than a 70% fixed income, 30% equity, 1.3x leverage index. It's a nice risky just
return. So is there, is there an environment or market environment? I would assume
environment like 2022 might be a little bit difficult on the strategy. Is there certain environments
for this works, you know, really well and it's 20% easier to make? You're absolutely right. I mean,
20% might be it was a really bad environment for this for the product, and it was a bad environment
for a lot of products. And, and what I take comfort in is the fact that over, you know, I think
it's, what I hear once in 50 years that they, they both acted like that, okay? I don't know,
it's like that the market's kind of pre-disastered over once in 50 years we got it last. That was,
that was, that was a really bad, that was probably the worst of. The tends to do, you know,
we're looking over a period of time, we would, we would, if you look over the longer periods of time,
balance portfolios tend to outperform on a risk of justice basis. It's just housed just
all they always do. And it doesn't matter if it's 70, 30, or it's 65, 35, or 75, 25.
You're going to, it's hard to predict exactly what the future's going to be. But we do know from,
you know, that diversification is the only free option. So, let's pivot just a little bit.
Let's talk about the marketing side of the index and the fund. How do you guys go about marketing
and how are you out there kind of distributing, I know you're not involved with the portfolio
management of the actual product or the, or the ETF itself through the index provider. But you
guys have done a really wonderful job, I think, with marketing and getting this out there. I mean,
the AAUM tells us the story. So, how are you guys out there marketing and telling the story and
raising those assets? Yeah. Well, we have excellent, excellent partners on the fund,
fun side strategy shares. These are gentlemen, David Miller, Michael Shinover, and Jerry
Solaji, who have built, you know, kind of a really impressive fund group for catalysts and
strategy shares and their various entities out. And they've done a lot of the, they do the,
you know, the primarily responsible for marketing and distribution of things. So, that night,
and they've done a really great job. I think it's a testament. But it's a testament to finding
the right product and fitting it with the right firm. Okay. You, one of the things you asked me was,
was, why did we focus on indexes if you had asked me earlier? But why we had focused on indexes?
And that happens to me what we're really good at. And I like indexes because indexes are rules
driven. And they, you know, in my history of active management, I've experienced in the past,
active managers who didn't necessarily follow their own investment philosophy. Whereas index
follows its own investment philosophy. And as long as it's well thought out and, you, you,
you know, live with the basic tenants and rules, it's going to be there and it's going to last
and it's going to go on. And similarly, a distributor has to do what they do well. And they have
their areas of expertise and things of it. And I think that this was a nice match for these two
products. Now, what we did, from the perspectives, we were very keen on our story and our points
and what, you know, what the product was and what the product was. Okay. It's not a guaranteed
we're going to earn 7%. It's, what's the best approach to try to take 7% out? How do you fit
that into your market? How do you fit out Mr. Viser? Where am I going to go again? A 7%
you know, constant return that's going to be a dependable, you know, some, a dependable
stream of risky, a risky gesture return level with a dependable set of distribution. That's
what ultimately somebody's looking. So, you know, it's, it's matching up with the right the right
distributor and the message and the product. And, and I think that that was what it was and it was
having a consistent, uh, I think a consistent, uh, rational story for why it, you were doing what
you were doing. And, and I think the index does speak to that, the index does, you know,
force that kind of, the kind of, kind of, diligence in the process. Yeah, it's funny you say,
you've seen active managers deviate from the process. One thing I've never understood like,
are everything we do is rules based, our indexes is passion rules based. And I've never understood
why an active manager would create a process and then deviate from the process if they've done
all of the due diligence and testing on the front end to make sure that it was robust. It just,
it never ceases to amaze me how many times they want to go in and tweak things or change things
just because maybe they had a bad run for a month or two months. I mean, it's just human nature.
I think it's the same thing that affects everybody else in the market and that's fear and greed.
And, you know, it's that or in this time that it's different. Those are the big dangerous words.
This time it's different. It's just not. Over time it's not. Okay. Last year it was unusual.
It's an unusual year forever. You know, it's a mix, the one thing that, you know,
my partner mad at at least points out and he goes, hey, it makes it much better entry point.
You know, and it's true. The truth of the matter is, is corrections are good from the market
because they make good entry. And if you enter at a proper time, you're here in a good shape.
Well, David, I really appreciate your time. I could talk to you for a long time, but I
would like to keep these two about 30 minutes of someone can listen to them on the way to work.
But I would love an opportunity, continue to dialogue with you and, you know,
continue to pick your brain on certain things. But before we go, working people are more about
your firm and where can people learn more about the handles ETF? Well, we have, we put out a
monthly, just a monthly report, that that just takes all of the constituents and shows the
performances. It's pretty straightforward and simple to read. You can get that either out in a
catalyst insights or NASDAQ or throw out a LinkedIn page, which is handles indexes. We have handles
indexes.com as a website that goes through and shows a lot of the things that we publish.
And wrote about it. And we wrote those things six and seven years ago. Those were not just written,
like, now, you know, we wrote those in advance of the concept and, and, and since I said it proved
out, but thank you very much. So handles indexes, which is H-A-N-D-L-S-I-N-D-E-X-E-S. The Nightmare
was built. Unbelievable. Well, David, again, thank you very much for joining us. I appreciate your
time. And again, I hope to, I hope to run into you some point in future. And thanks for,
thanks for taking some time with me. Thank you, Brad. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.
