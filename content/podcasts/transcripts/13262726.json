  "transcript": "Welcome to Behind the Ticker.\nI'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.\nBehind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry.\nWe will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses.\nWe will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company.\nMany of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.\nPlease note, nothing in this show is investment advice, and it is meant solely for educational\nand entertainment purposes only.\nWelcome to Behind the Ticker.\nToday we have John Dovey.\nHe is the founder of Astoria Advisors.\nWe talk about their ETF Ticker PPI, which is inflation-sensitive strategy.\nWe talk about John's business.\nJohn, like us, runs a model business as well as an ETF, so it was interesting to get his\nperspective on both.\nI think you will enjoy hearing about their inflation-sensitive ETF, especially after everything\nwe have gone through in terms of inflation over the last handful of years.\nPlease enjoy this episode with John Dovey.\nHey, John, welcome to the show.\nGood to be here.\nThanks for your time.\nSo John is from Astoria Advisors.\nHe's got an SMA business, kind of an OCIO business, some research in there.\nI believe I saw the ETF we are going to talk about, PPI, but before we get into that,\nwhy don't you tell me a little bit about your background and how you got to start\nbeing a story advisers?\nYeah, sure.\nSo spent 20 years doing institutional research, portfolio construction for firms like Maryland,\nMorgan Stanley, so 10 years of Maryland, 10 years of Morgan Stanley, I started my career actually\nin quantitative research, so kind of late 90s, I know quantitative analysis, portfolio\nconstruction is very much in both, but back then it was all about single stocks and fundamental\nresearch and being an institutional I rank, like that was the big thing in research and\neven at the sell side, but from a stand start, it was always about how do you build\nportfolios that delivered unique sources of risk and return for institutional investors.\nAlways had a macro kind of lens, so the goal was to join the buy side and to be an entrepreneur\nand I just thought that it'd be helpful to do both at the same time, so 2017 started\na story, and the firm has been growing since 2017, myself and my other kind of partners\nand colleagues, all have an institutional caliber background, either worked on the sell side,\nwhether they're in sales, trading, we've got a couple of younger analysts and they come\nat school, but they very much are being kind of engulfed in this institutional caliber\nresearch and portfolio construction, so that's a little bit about us.\nWe do service other RAs, other independent advisors that are looking for outsourced solutions,\nwhether it be strategic asset allocation, quantitative stock selection, and obviously now we\nhave the PPI to have two, so that's open to a whole new kind of worms.\nYeah, and I want to talk about all that as we kind of move forward with the conversation,\nbut before we talk about the business stuff, I always like to ask each guest, you know,\nwhat do they like to do for fun?\nYou have any hobbies outside of just working?\nI've got three kids, two teenage daughters and a two-year-old son, so my time is very much\nspent with my family.\nIt's going to be June, but I'm starting to do my kayaking and biking and cycling, so I\nlike to do outdoor activities, as I get older, I definitely appreciate the warm weather more\nand more.\nI very much enjoy sports, grow up as a die hard kind of New York Metz fan, Jets fan,\nso it's been quite a struggle, it's been the so many that's from Pittsburgh, that has had a lot\nof success with their sports teams the last 20 years, but you know, between sports and family\nand physical activity, those are my kind of passions.\nYeah, well other than the pirates over here, you're right, we've been pretty fortunate, and\nunlike you, I also have a two-year-old son, so you and I are going through a\ngoing through the same thing right now, but they're getting to the fun stage, so\nyeah, it's not, it's not too bad anymore, so primarily I want to talk to you about PPI,\nbut before we do, let's talk about a story advises a whole, so you kind of touched on who you\nwork with, so you work with registered investment advisors, maybe let's dive in a little bit\nmore into what you guys do, we have a very similar business, except I noticed when I kind of\nlooked at the ADV, do you also custody assets as well as provide model portfolios, like outsource\nmodel portfolios as well? Okay, good question, so custody is a very legalish term, let me drive\nthe point home, a lot of advisors we work with, like they don't want to touch the portfolio\ntoo much deal of corporate actions, Robinson, Taxos, Harveston, so we empower advisors by\nbuilding solutions, and then they really do like that we're actually physically doing the trade\nin the imbalance in corporate actions, raising cash needs, so you know I think some of my peers\nand I'm not sure what your firm exactly does, but like they all have like their strategic\ngas allocation model on a temp, like SCI investment and say you know we're the best thing on\nearth by our strategies on investment, we've kind of decided that we didn't want to take that approach\nonly because a, you know, Stanit Star at the firm started in 2017 you didn't have like a\ntrack record let's say second like you know I just think like if we could be the vanguard of like\nyou know the SMA world and just give people a low price point you know the investments of the\nworld the SCI's listen they're publicly traded companies I get it and they have some pretty serious\nbackers but it's all pretty expensive too right 30, 40 basis point I think like you know the way\nwe operate where you know we could be a lot more hands on right like so you can get 10,000 strategies\non investment it's probably overkill you know we deliver you those blended ETF models those strategic\ngas allocation portfolios we've got a suite of quantitative stock models and then advisors like\nmix in and match and so a little bit of stocks a little bit of like short duration bonds in\nor to target a standard deviation so in our ADV you'll see that we have like maybe 300 plus\nmillion in assets that we physically touch we call that physical sub advisor the rest of it is\nwhere we're outsource CIO or somebody's hiring us and saying okay John is going to help\nJohn as team is going to help actually build the portfolio but we want to do the portfolio manage\nwith ourselves so that's what we call like OCI work and that's considered like a UA per se yeah\nso we do more of the OCI work rather than physical touching the assets and and that's interesting\nyou're almost like a providing tampelike services while still providing your strategies which I\nthink is is extremely useful because you're right some of these larger tamps can get expensive\nand and and and you're and you're also right that there's way too many strategies on there\nfor advisors to choose from so I really appreciate you kind of going through that because I\nwant to when I was going through it I wasn't sure if you had a separate business where you\nwere working directly with clients but it's just sounds like you're working with RA is directly\nand totally so independent RA is that you know like sub you know half a billion but that's\nkind of the sweet spot once you get past half a billion you know they had their own trader\ntheir own CIO and then it's like you know it's we become less appealing to them per se but that's\nbeen the business plan so far and you know maybe that evolves over time but for now you know I\nthink like the firm kind of pride dissolves and our research and you know how we build portfolios\nand then the add-on is like the operational aspect the what we do so in terms of building\nportfolios that these RAs are utilizing you know how how how how do those investment decisions\nget made how are you building those portfolios it much like the quantitative lens that you\nyou know you worked in prior or kind of talk about your investment philosophy as a whole on how\nyou're making investment decisions so so the goal would be so we have a couple pillars and then\nwe have like a slide deck that I could you know kind of point you know watchers and listeners too\nbut you know we believe in after tax after inflation risk adjuster returns so those are some pretty\nserious words after tax that's important right that's what tax was harvison so you go on a\ntemp and not going to tax was harvison I don't think nearly as frequently as we can the beauty\nof ETFs is that once you get in those big building blocks like you know large cap you know\nmake cap let's say you know there's a number of ETFs you can tax those harvison after tax return\nis quite important after inflation that's a big thing we've always had inflation linked assets in\nour models since 2017 usually it's been gold there's been times where we own physical commodities\nvia the ETF but we've always had inflation risk whether it's 2% 9% or now 6% 5% like that compound\nespecially when you invest for 20 30 years like 2% a year for 30 is as meaningful so I just talked\nabout after inflation I talked about after tax so risk adjusted is interesting like okay you know\nyou can generate and you know harry mark which just passed away rust and peace you know risk\nadjusted returns like you know you can just own growth stocks call it a day seven\nthings stocks that's a lot of risk I know you're being compensated this year but last year\nmaybe you weren't like so you know this things that happen I just did a call when advised\nare walking through like our risk based ETF models and like showing him the return\ndifferences between like our 50 50 stock bond portfolio versus like our 70 30 stock portfolio\nlike there's things that in bonds bonds there are parts of the bond market where there's embedded\nrisk premium or you can capture so we like to use stocks and bonds and alternatives because\nyou know the way we manage our portfolios like there's just things that we know are going to happen\nwith all those three components stocks bonds commodities and alternatives and they can generate\na much more smoother portfolio experience so our investment discipline is macro plus quant I find\nfirms are either macro focus or the quant focus but it's rare to have both so in an ideal world like\nyou know we have let's say a 70 30 stock 70 30 each equity bond portfolio on slash alternatives\nlike we're investing across different factors factors are cyclical some work better than others\ndependent where you are in the cycle so we like to harvest a portfolio of factors on the equity side\nsame thing with the bonds and you know like we use alternatives to kind of hedge our downside\nrisk so that's kind of in a nutshell we've got something on our website called cycle indicated\nthat we'll walk through 60 slides walk through each one of our indicators where we in the cycle\nwe have like a lot of bifurcation in data today you know we're doing this podcast on June 27\nwe have some strong hasn't data some strong building permits to announce today market zone quite\nwell that's good but there's a number of other indicators I think that are not as attractive or\nyou know maybe they haven't reached their function point so we're at a tricky point in\ncycle where you know rate cuts are not on the horizon in fact we're still talking about rate hikes\nyou know here in the US so you know that that lend itself to how we're thinking about portfolio\nconstruction how we only be tilted across US international so that's a little bit about\nour portfolio construction process let's dive into that just a little bit deeper so\ndepending on where you are in terms of that cycle thesis using your indicators\nis that going to change the asset allocation inside of your portfolio let's say it's a 70-30\nportfolio and you're in a certain part of the cycle let's just say you're a a cycle do you believe\nthat the market might go through some volatility or some downside or we might have a recession\nare you going to be tilting that portfolio actively to make it less risky or is it just\nin terms of providing insights and research to clients so yeah so good question lot the\nunpack that I would say that what we're trying to do is okay so we kind of identified going into this\nyear that you know we were kind of late cycle you know we if you went to our outlook report we said\nthere were three things that the market was priced in and earnings recession economic recession\nand then you know some like deft comp five downfall in the S&P right like another 20% so\nwe thought there would be one of those like all three would not going to happen right a\neconomic recession earnings recession and another deft comp five draw it on the S&P by the way we\nhad one last year or S&P fell something like 28 30% closed down in the year 18 but we rallied significantly\nyou know from October 12 through the end of the year so you know basically everyone missed this call\nwe said that we thought there were some green shoots too like China reopened and that was I think\npretty important I think you know what we missed pretty big this year was like the fact that a\ntrillion dollars of fiscal stimulus was added to the economy so things like you know the snap\nprogram extension and Medicaid you know the student loan you know program so you know it's funny\nlike then you had like the silicon valley bank you know crisis and and that added more to the\nfeds balance sheet the point is like we do look at these things like we just decided this year\nlike okay like we still want to be relatively defensive because we do acknowledge that even\nnow I just said like building permits were good you know housing data today was good you know there's\na number of other indicators like a point to you that show that like okay you know maybe the earnings\nyou know outlook for the second half of the year is too rosy let's say right you know maybe\nyou know there's lead economic indicators OECD that are still trying to find a foot in right\nso we just want to be honest and acknowledge okay there's some good there's some bad but overall\nlike not everything aligns all at once you don't get the green light and every indicator but like\nlet's be strategic with our tilt so okay instead of only just a massive amount of treasuries let's\nnibble on high quality corporate credit so things like SPI B you know we kind of added to our portfolio\nin case the economy does go into recession let's buy some SPTL like the long data you know\npart of the bond market which has a lot of convexity is very sensitive in case a recession hits right\nlet's add you know we have lower beta so let's add some beta but let's do it in like things like\nIHDG international high quality you know ETFs so so that's how we're thinking about portfolio\nconstruction like we're not tactical we do look at where we are in the cycle you know look at\nthese various indicators and then we try and strategically tell to once twice a year it's a\ncourse satellite approach so you've got your core tickers which in theory shouldn't change at all ever\nand then you got you satellite you satellite can and I'm not talking about buying like exely is a satellite\nright to me exely is like a tactical decision like you know that's separate right like right\nyour money that's not a core strategic ticker let's say but you know a satellite could be like\nokay like small caps right there's an embedded risk premium small caps stocks do well over time\nbut clearly they're not good when the economy is slowing right so like we would have sold our\nsmall cap ETF last year right I think like if I'm thinking forward in a year if we get some like\nre-eceleration and economy these OECD leading the economic indicators in flood tire\nthen we're going to see like things like cyclicals in flood tire small caps in flood tire\nso we would like start to enter into position in some of those tickers that we like you know\nmaybe next year a Q1 Q2 of next year as we see a cycle playout this is super interesting and\nI hope you don't mind I know we're here to talk about you know PPI but this I find your portfolio\nconstruction interesting and I like this idea of having really a passive tactical piece with\na satellite side of it that can kind of be a little bit more tactical right you said it's not\ntactical but it sounds like you're looking for some spaces to be able to you know take advantage\nof some opportunity so when let's just stay with the 70-30 portfolio 70% equity 30% fixed income\nwhat portion of that portfolio is going to stay kind of core passive and what how much you're\ngoing to sleep away to be as you call it kind of satellite um I try and keep it where it's like half\nthe portfolio is ticker is that aren't going to change the other half are up for review with the\ngoal of like no more than like 30 to 35% turnover on average per year assuming that like it's normal\nmarket conditions sometimes it just could be like a big ticker swap like not that were tactical but\nyou know we made a decision years ago to kind of split our currency risk like half currency hedge\nhalf unhead so like that was like a decent sized ticker swap but that's not like us being tactical\nright um yeah we just subscribed to the idea that like you know are you getting paid for owning\nyou know kind of taking on the currency risk I think some of our alternatives have evolved over\nyears so we so you mentioned 70-30 but that 30 bonds is going to be like half that bond and\nhalf that alternatives so things like merger arbitrage I think works well when you have like a\nboom in economy where people feel especially when you've got a lower interest rate environment that's\nfor sure that's the best for merger arbitrage whereas now you got the opposite right you got like a\nSloan economy high interest rate so if you look at like all the investment banks like the deal count\ntheir IPO it's like out of stance so right or was because corporates are just trying to get\nunderstand and of how do you live now in a world where you had zero entry policy 15 years and now you've\ngot you know five and a half percent unfit funds right so like our alternatives have me and fleeing\ninvolved uh evolved um things like PPI like you know made it into our portfolios you know kind of\nyear year and a half ago that's a decent sized allocation in our alternatives like that evolved\nbecause we felt strongly about inflation um so half of it is like kind of stays in the portfolio\nhalf of it is up for review depending on where we are in cycle yeah that's that's interesting thanks\nfor explaining that to me um kind of one last question because you and I are both in this you know\nmodel business outside of the ETF what do you find to be most frustrating for you uh in that business\nI know I have my opinion but I'd like to get yours what's most frustrating the models business\nyeah well here I'll give you mine um it's it's really frustrating I mean we have I don't know\n10 models it's really frustrating to me when we we sit down you know with an advisor and we we lay out\na really nice asset allocation between our models but uh one sleeve of that asset allocation does\nreally well and they want a strategy chase it and then all of a sudden um they are they're making\na tactical move within our strategies to get a chase performance right whether it's a single stock\ngrowth model it's happening this year right uh growth obviously tech was bad 2022 model didn't\nperform well it is started off the year with an absolute bang and now everybody wants to chase back\ninto growth and back into uh specifically unprofitable tech growth so that for me is very frustrating\nand I don't know if you have the same problem or if you have your hands on the steering wheel a little\nbit more than maybe that we do no I think we have the same frustration uh performance chase and\nis real you know I think like um there's a lot of people that talk about this like how long can you\nlet a strategy on the perform right I mean you do you should have you know three years five\nyears ten years like let a manager kind of play out their views you know what you'll find on us\nis that like because we allocate towards alternatives and alternatives let's say are a drag on portfolio\nlike you like we look at alternatives as insurance right like you need an event to happen for\nthen insurance kick in like car insurance right you get into car accident boom you're you're\npremium they pay a year finally gets you know put to use right so you know we we just need like\nevents to happen for our models to kind of outperform that benchmark straight up bull markets\ndelta long seven stocks driving S&P is tough when you're global when you're diversified\ncourse factors and you have alternatives um so I think like if you look at our fact sheets you know\nwe have like trail in one three five since inception returns you know be the you'll determine\nwhat you think of that um but you do need you know years and years to go buy for these used to play out\nyou know it's same thing like ppi like you know we had this view about inflation\nin June of 2020 I went on CBC and I said I was on Bob Pazoniz ETF ad show and I said look you know\nin my economics 101 class they told me that if you restrict supply you increase demand prices go up\nand and back then this was before covid remember covid was announced in November 2020\nto death to the US selection and nobody was talking about inflation nobody was like so it took a\nwhile for the thesis to play out that was equally frustrating okay like we told people okay we think\nwe could have a problem let's head to your inflation risk so you know for our inflation sensitive\nmodel portfolio we cobble together like 10 tickers and then we added that as a sleeve to our core\nstrategic models and then like we had this big boom inflation you know it went up a lot now it's\ncoming down and you know that also gets frustrating too because you know we could talk more about\nppi and how it's been doing and it's portfolio construction but yeah I think you know the time\nis of the essence when it comes to like you know advisors and they have very short of time to spend\nyeah I find that I find that as well so one last question before we dive really deep into ppi\nwith all of these other strategies that you run do you have plans to launch any more funds or is\nis ppi going to be you know your single strategy or I should say you're single ETF moving forward\nwell I think like we're at an interesting position because you know we do have you know some\nsuccess with ppi and it's open our eyes to like okay what could the future look like for us you know\nso I think like you know in we're never going to be the next you know eye shares or wisdom\ntree or pastry tfs but if there's a few interesting tickers that we can bring to the market\nthat helps solve an internal problem that we're having you know I think that could you know\nmy frustration with okay you start with the S&P right that's got like 33% technology and\ncommunication stocks so to me that's an issue just because there's like too much sensitivity to like\none sector and values that've got up and now that's some piece back to being expensive and then now\nall the smart bait ETFs are optimized against the S&P like everything is against the S&P\nif you think the S&P is flawed your smart bait ETFs is going to be flawed too so like it's it's\nmaking our portfolios somewhat concern in where it's like you know in these smart bait ETFs\nare passive right so how do they go from passive to now being more active like I do think you\nwant to be more active given where we are on the cycle so yeah I would agree with that so\nlet's talk about PPI which is inflation sensitive ETF you guys are on the narrative and the\nticker I'm assuming I should say the environment and the ticker symbol itself is probably when\ngood for you you know especially with inflation ramping and you got a the perfect ticker for inflation\nsensitive ETF so could you explain what PPI is is meant to do and then we'll talk about how the\ninvestment process works in the selection but what is it really designed to do so it's designed to kind\nof help a multi-ass portfolio deal with inflation pressures okay and in actual that's what it's\ntrying to do it trying to give you exposure to different parts of the capital market system that are\nyou know that are going to be sensitive to inflation you know at the end of the day like these are\ngrowth sensitive business cycle sensitive sectors so we're leaning on energy,\nwe're leaning on materials and dust drills little bit of financials that makes up the equity\nside we have an allocation towards commodities and commodities and commodities and then we have a\nlittle bit of an exposure to tips so it's a multi-ass to class ETF but basically the way that I think\nwe're thinking about portfolio construction is that different parts of the inflation sectors are\ngoing to respond definitely depending on where we're on the inflation cycle you know when we first launched\ninflation was ramped right we launched we developed the SMA you know 2020 we launched with access\ninvestments that the advisor with the sub advisor we launched it on December 2021 so like CPI was\njust kind of trending higher I'm like really going from like I don't remember the exact numbers but\nwe launched it and it was still trending like 7, 8, 9 yeah so in that very acute stage of sharp inflation\nwe leaned very heavily on energy materials right that was also correspond to like Q1 the Russia attack\nof Ukraine in 2022 if you remember the S&P kind of fell apart in 2022 right inflation was ramped\nthe Fed had to go very aggressively right so then the ETF evolved right because then we got to a\npoint where the Fed was hiking interest rate very aggressively it pushed up real rates right and then\nwe were leaning more towards tips and other parts of fixed income so it evolved like where it got to like\n85% maybe in cyclical stocks and these energy materials and industrials we've since downgraded\nwhere you know we're actively managing it right so now we it's about 72% 72% cyclical stocks\nnatural resource stocks commodity equity stocks about you know 10 to 15% physical commodity\nmostly in gold and then like you know 10 to 15% ish and tips ETFs so one ticker solution that kind\nof gives you exposure to different parts of the inflation cycle but you know the point is like\nthose are the four sectors that lean on is energy materials industrials and financials because those\nare the ones that like very sensitive to the growth cycle and to the business cycle yeah so you\nare the you better you kind of hit on this in terms sorry did you have something else you wanted\nto add that I just want thing I mean the you know the P ratio currently right now is about eight\nyou know these are cheap stocks right it's very difficult to find cheap stocks in an era where\nthe S&P is you know 20 times you know forward earnings I've seen periods of my career where\nenergy stocks are much higher in terms of valuation you know when I saw my career energy stocks were\nnot the 15% of the S&P suck the weight there was you know there's been times where it's like 20\n25 not in my career but like in the 70s which is it's an interesting point right because\nenergy got down to like two-three percent you know because of the last decade it's a little bit\nabout tech you know ESG type stuff so like it's just interesting how like these sectors you know\nI have just that's why it's a nice compliment and a multi-ass portfolio that's got a lot of tech\nduration risk you know nominal bond risk so we're using it as an alternative in order to hedge\nthe other exposures in your portfolio like you're not dumping spy to buy PPI like that's not what you\ndo and like you trim back some of your equities and allocate towards PPI and the 2022 when\nS&P was down 18 PPI was up for right past performance on dick if you result that was one year but like\nit was an inversely correlated alternative last year this year S&P up 15 PPI is kind of flat in the\nyear depending on day up one maybe up two down one down two so you know different return profile this year\nbut you know at the end of the day these are like a 7 P ratio right it's very very cheap so how\nwere you doing how are you looking at I understand all of that but in terms of actually picking\nthe underlying names in the portfolio how does that security selection process work so that's the\nkind of true north of a story a quantitative you know systematic portfolio construction on on the\nstock side so outside of our ETF managed portfolios we have a quantitative stock portfolios\nadvises I want it so it's a robust screen we're looking at ultimately in a day we're looking for\ncheap stocks with strong strong growth prospects good momentum that have shown sensitivity to CPI\nhistorically and that are high quality in nature so looking at those four sectors that I mentioned\nand in mind for the off in the beta five U.S. stocks five nine U.S. stocks so kind of 40 stocks\nlet's say in general and then there's like you know some ETFs for like tips and commodities exposure\nbut it's very kind of rules based systematic the active element is like how we allocate across\nstocks and bonds and commodities yeah and then in terms of waiting decisions and and also you\nknow rebalancing you know since it's an active fund I'm sure you can just you rebalance unless you have\nrebalance schedule but as far as waiting inside of those different pockets that is that decision also\nfluid or do you have kind of guardrails on the weightings in terms of the difference between\nequities and tips and all the other buckets yes so good question so it is not a tactical strategy\nwhere it's going to go to like a hundred percent tips because we're thinking about like dearest\nagain because I don't know this some invasion and Ukraine or something like that like that's not what\nit does like of course we're active so we don't have to like have a rule in place where we say okay\nwe're going to be like no more than 20 percent fixed income yeah today we've run it for you know\nyear and a half we've kept the bands like 70 to 80 percent 85 percent stocks you know 10\n15 percent you know kind of tips somewhere around there for commodities you know rebalances like twice a\nyear I can review our you know tell it's across the asset class level quarterly but it's not\nyou know it's not meant to kind of go a hundred percent goal because you know we have like an issue\nin the global economy and that's not what it meant to like we just had this view it's like these\nstocks are so cheap you know like we feel like we can lean on those stocks especially if it's put\ninto like a multi-ass portfolio that has like a large cap core large cap blend exposures\nbecause those by definition you're going to have a lot of technology stocks which by definition\nare sensitive to rates sensitive to duration and evidence number one is like what happened to\ntech and stocks when you know interest rates went up a lot and you know last year so yeah so\nthat actually feeds into one of my one of my questions which is if you're working if you're talking\nto an advisor a new advisor you don't have a OCI a relationship with you're you're not running an\nSMA for how would you kind of talk to them about using PPI in there already diversified model portfolio\nsweet like what type of allocation would you suggest and and where would you put that in kind of a\nmodel portfolio for an advisor that you know already has an existing sweet or an existing model\nportfolio that running so I think it should come more from the equity side because that's what it\nlike if you sell equity you know like if you sold your bonds to buy PPI like you know think of\nPPI's like a 70 equity 15 bonds 15 commodities right so you should kind of proportionally\ntrim your exposures that way you know I think like the way we've done it which is use it as an alternative\nand just kind of look at as like an inflation insurance right you know as long as you like I have\ncar insurance right cost us two grand in New York to you know cover two cars with two\ndrivers like no matter what like we're going to spend that two grand and got for a big amount to\ncar accident guy goes going to like you know help cover the the cost right but we have a deductible\nyou don't have a deductible on PPI you know but like the point is like I don't try and time my\ncar insurance my home insurance my life insurance we just had that premium you know and and I said like\nyou know we just have this view like our pillars are after tax after inflation risk adjuster\nreturn PPI I think demonstrated last year that you know it did well when you had rampant inflation\nour firm views that were going to be in a high inflation environment for many years by the way\nBrad if I'm crazy right CPI has gotten 2% like maybe it was below 2% but like the point is every\nyear there's inflation right so as long as you size it so I think like 3 to 5% depend on how much\nequities you have in your portfolio I think it's going to be there and it's going to pass before\nit's on ticket future results but that's how we view PPI as an alternative inflation insurance\nyeah no and I would agree with that and so let's as we wrap up here I think that was a great\ndive into what PPI does and I just would want to ask some questions about how you're going\nabout marketing the fund right how what are some of the things you're doing I talk to a lot of\nmanagers on here I talk to people who are in the service side of the business and the number one\nthing is it's really hard to get out there and sell these things so how was your firm how was the\nstory kind of positioning PPI and how are you getting out there and trying to sell it and grow\ngrowth fund yeah and so access investment is the advisor so they're primarily responsible for sales\nin marketing where the portfolio manager is you know I'm a content generator so you know it's\nhelpful because I come with a big you know kind of media presence and you know this is what we do\nlike we're a sub advisor for a lot of RA so I know exactly how to like communicate the message\nonce we get people on the phone I don't want to speak on behalf of access but you know they've got\ntheir own distribution channels you know digital market in you know they've got a process for kind of\nhow they you know email campaigns and drip campaigns and whatnot so let me bring that question to\nlike what I see other issuers do you know what our name and their name specifically but I think\nin general for ETF small niche players like your firm our firm access and other ones that are\nsub couple billion in assets like you've got to have like digital market in presence you've got to\nbe a content generator you got to like you know you're playing in like you're fishing in the palm\nthat's got a lot of fish like how do you stand out and you know I'm a big believer on if you can\nbring assets to the table that gets you to like the first hump right because the pushback\nyou always get from people is okay with your size right yeah so if you're like three to five\nmillion assets like you're on doom dooms that scenario yeah what you start getting past you know 50\nhundred million like you know the ETF like starts to have like a life of its own so I'm a big fan\nof like creating digital content digital market in you know just talking about markets like\nportfolio construction okay you know what is this burn view a story about markets in the fed\nand then you know that build you online presence with people yeah I think the most frustrating\nthing and we've got a we're we're now in you know in that 1500 million dollar size the most\nfrustrating question was or or a bottle to when we would talk to advisors is well it doesn't\nhave any volume and I'm like volume is not indicative of liquidity you know let's let's move on past\nthat but I did as your app up here I did want to say I noticed you you have done a lot of media\nI was on your site today so you you've done a great job of getting yourself out there getting on\nCNBC getting on all the big networks and so how is that kind of help you tell a story to advisors\nnot just with PPI with other things you know do you see that as a a big proponent to\nallowing your firm to continue its growth yeah I mean I publish institutional research for you\nknow 20 years before you know I started the story so I just I've had some relationships with the\nmedia you know but to be clear Brad like you know more than a Maryland so they didn't care if I\nwent on TV like it was about published from research getting institutional clients to like read the\nresearch you know transact with these firms like that was very important like drive revenue so\nI was kind of business savvy you know what I would say is that you know in this world like\nthe buy side you know you you've got to have like a present so just if you don't have relationships\nhow do you do it like once you start getting bulk on Twitter and people start following you I think\nlike these media personality guys would acknowledge you so you just kind of kind of got to get out there\nbut you know it's not just me right there's a team up behind me that empowers me you know we've got\nthree safe phase on staff and we've got you know full sales and marketing department you know we\nwork very well as a team so I think you know you got to have a good call you got to be out there a\nlittle bit and then you got to be right so nobody wants to put you on TV if you're a long\nconstantly so you better be right is the point yeah well John this has been very helpful\nand I really appreciate your time before I let you go where can people learn more about PPI and\nand also learn more about a story advisors yes if you go to story advisors dot com go on Twitter\nadd a story advisors that's the best way to find information about the firm and you'll find information\nabout all our solutions okay well great John again thank you for taking the time for being here\nwith us today and I look forward to you know having the opportunity to one day hopefully meet you in\nperson yeah yeah my wife fans from Pittsburgh so I'm there you know once a year at least so all right\nwell you have to shoot me a note and I'm in New York probably six times a year so maybe I'll run\nand see you one day down down on the floor but again John
