Any hobbies when you're not behind the desk?\nYeah, probably just think traditional portfolio managers do real portfolio manager, little golf, little poker and maybe occasionally a little bourbon.\nYeah, I'm more of a clear guy myself. I can't get into bourbon and it leads to a poor morning for me.\nWell, just a little bit. It's just a little bit.\nSo you guys do a lot of things over it tortoise.\nYou know, can you maybe talk about the firm as a whole and all the things you do to kind of help clients?\nYeah, so tortoise, our focus is we're really dedicated to the energy sector. That's what we've really been since the beginning for really over two decades of an existence.\nFocus on the energy sector. Really, I've always seen a huge opportunity in the energy sector because of the essential nature of it.\nAnd so our goal obviously is to deliver the highest risk of just returns we can for clients because energy is so important.\nObviously, there's a lot going on in energy and frankly, you know, there are a lot of market cycles in energy, a lot of market cycles in general in the broad market.\nBut our goal is to position clients we think or the best opportunities are in the energy sector.\nYeah, so we're here to talk today primarily about TPC, which is the tortoise central energy fund.\nSo at a very high level, you know, what is this fund trying to accomplish?\nYeah, so with this fund, what we're trying to accomplish is simply where are the opportunities in energy.\nSo energy, it weren't a new era of energy, right? So everybody likes ETFs.\nThis ETF gives us the flexibility to look at the energy sector and say, no, not only where to be positioned today, but more importantly, what do you want to be positioned?\nWhere's the puck going in energy? And that's really why we have this fund. And so that's how we're positioning it is. Where's the future?\nSo the answer to that is, well, well, we see electrification being a huge opportunity.\nThat's driven by AI. What does that mean? That means electricity demand in the U.S. is going up because of AI and other things.\nAnd so that there's opportunities there. We see energy exports increasing out of the U.S. as well.\nSo our fund is designed to capture these big picture macro themes, you know, within individual stocks, while providing some current income to the shareholders of TPC.\nYeah, and we're going to kind of talk about all that. One of the things that I was curious about just from a business standpoint is the fund, this fund transition from a closed end fund to an ETF kind of late in 2024.\nKind of what motivated that decision and really how is that impacted investor access and really the way the fund operates?\nYeah, so tortoise has multiple investment products across our platform and as you know, I like Brad, we had some some closed end funds that were training at discounts and we have brought in some new management at tortoise and was there suggestion that you know what\nWhy don't should we consider an active ETF because we had net we didn't have an active ETF at tortoise and with the funds with the closed end funds trading in a discount and obviously with the shareholder approvals.\nNot only at the individual shareholder level, but at the board level, we were able to convert those from closed end funds to active ETF obviously that was beneficial's great great decision on behalf of our management here because narrow the discounts.\nActually got rid of the discounts for the for the closed end fund shareholders consolidated a you know, you get now you got to benefit a scale a bit with now one active ETF and like I said gives us the opportunity now to look forward and and and and really position the portfolio.\nWhere are the energy sectors going from here.\nYeah, and so let's kind of talk about the portfolio a little bit. I know one of the objectives is to provide you know income also total return. I saw that will talk about that in a little bit.\nBut you do this through mix of equities, bonds, MLPs, can you kind of walk us through how that allocation works and really how you guys are deciding what mix makes sense given kind of current market conditions.\nYeah, and you and you hit on the point it's more conditions it's more where we are in the market cycle.\nBut but generally speaking, we've been weighted, you know, probably 80% equities 20% fixed income in general. Well, you know, we'll probably always be 10 to 20% fixed income in that range and 80 to 90% equities depending on on your or view on the economy rates and some of the more macro driving factors.\nBut but once again, more the bigger picture perspective is is, you know, what what are the best opportunities in the energy sector and how do we best capture those and and provide those to to the to the investors ultimately.\nAnd so so we've got a lot of those positions. Are we positioned the portfolio right now to capture a lot of those and and we can talk about if you want what where we are positioned in across the sector.\nYeah, we're definitely going to talk about that. I think what would be you know interesting as you said that the fun is active.\nIt's got about 86% active share, which means you're doing something very meaningfully different than your benchmark and you know what kinds of exposures or strategies are you using to maybe find those opportunities and generate those kind of those active moves or you know your conviction of where to move.\nSo, you know, this isn't a traditional energy index. This is a it's an active product. So can you maybe kind of walk me through the investment philosophy or investment thesis on how you're figuring out where you want to move next or where your tilts are going to be.\nYeah, that's a great point. So so you know that the traditional ETF space or investors investing in the ETF space effectively had you know maybe one or two options. But the biggest option is obviously.\nThe XLE and that's a passive product and you know it's it's highly concentrated and X on Chevron kind of go fill up basically who are oil and gas producers. We have nothing against the oil that those companies obviously well well run well managed companies.\nBut there's a lot going on in the energy sector and that's that's that's what I like to say is that's why tortoise. This is all we do. We did it. We're dedicated to we got a good size team here. We focus on the entire energy sector not just oil and gas producers. We look at oil and gas producers.\nBut we also focus on energy infrastructure. We also focus on refining electric utilities, petrochemicals and so renewable energy. So there's there's a lot of things that we're looking at.\nThat are going on in the industry sector. It's a big space. It's a complicated space. But it's really interesting. You think about what's going on energy. You know people think energy they're energy. They think oil and gas. So they think drive their cars eat their homes.\nIt's way more than that. No energy basically is driving both the global well the domestic economy. But as well as the global economy. So we're looking across all of these opportunities and and and finding what we think are the best really risk adjusted opportunities for shareholders.\nYeah, so maybe diving in there just a little bit deeper. Is it, you know, kind of a top down fundamental process or are you using some sort of quantitative approach like what is the underlying kind of investment thesis when you say okay here.\nWe this is what we believe this is where we have conviction these are the types of companies we want to invest in you know can you talk a little bit more about how you derive it allocate asset allocation.\nYeah, we look at that so we so we break down the energy sector into multiple sub sectors we evaluate each sub sector on its fundamentals.\nAnd when we look at the fundamentals we're looking at the quality the cash flows we're looking at the the growth profile the potential growth profile of the business that you know operating margins the traditional fundamental metrics.\nWe we also look at the valuations obviously that's important as well and and you know trying to find opportunities where you know the the fundamentals and the valuations maybe are disconnected obviously the market hasn't reflected yet the the valuations in the individual stocks.\nAnd then we look at the obviously focus on the the quality of the management teams as well and and we've got a long track record of being in the sector and and evaluate those management teams on on on you know their governance but also you know their share ownership and things along those lines and we look a little bit at the technicals and and and how the stocks have been trading.\nSo we're relative to things like RSI and things like that but we do a top down but then also on that we do a bottoms up approach we have our own proprietary financial models where we build build them the the.\nYou know balance sheets and companies cash flow statements these companies really look at the companies that that can grow that can grow meaningfully but but also are disciplined as well and you know don't have inflated balance sheets and so we're doing a lot of work on the top down but also the bottoms up to to formulate our opinions.\nSure so like if I'm if I'm reading this correctly I'm not an energy expert it appears you guys have quite a focus currently in that like liquids infrastructure and natural gas.\nSo it kind of what are the outlook on those segments and why are you kind of focusing and emphasizing that particular part of the business right now.\nYes so so Brad the way we look at it is we really think that the energy sectors being redefined and the future of the energy sector is going to be about natural gas.\nToday oil you know a lot of people like I said thank energy they think oil and that's and that's fine oils not going away but but the growth in oil demand both domestically and globally has started the slow it will continue to slow we think.\nAnd and and the reason for that is if you think about what's going on the energy sector it's really exciting right now because for the first time in my really three decades of looking at the energy sector.\nThe energy sector and the technology sector are kind of intertwined they're they're moving together and that's because of the development of artificial intelligence they.\nSo obviously the technology sector doing a great job of developing the technology around AI but the energy sector is doing a great job of providing the electricity.\nAnd because there's there is no way AI without AI there's no AI without energy infrastructure and so that that that that's that's what we're really excited about because we think to say.\nAI opportunities a long term secular trend it offers a catalyst for the energy sector a growth catalyst for the energy sector so energy is already providing a lot of.\nstable income for for investors and and that's not going away but now we've got the end we've got income and now we've got a growth catalyst that I think well really position a sector going for.\nBut all of that's happening or a lot of that's happening within different sectors of the energy sector and natural gas in particular is is the one area where we think that that that that there's going to that that's going to benefit the most from this.\nYeah, no, I totally agree with your thesis it isn't exciting time with you think about what the energy demand is going to be for AI and I think that that's just really getting started as we continue to see them build these giant data centers and everything that's needed to kind of.\nYou know support the AI infrastructure effort but.\nOne of the things that outside of just kind of selecting a theme and finding the right places to invest there is an income tilt to this portfolio so you guys will use fixed income and option overlay so like how do those components contribute to your income generation strategy and are you tactical with those tools or is it kind of.\nYou said it to a target just can you talk about that income component yeah yes so so we want to do we do want to deliver some income to two investors we think that that's a really important component I think our dividend yields we speak right now is about 5% on the portfolio and we always will.\nWe'll we'll strive to provide current income that's that's higher than than then you know competing energy ETFs like the excel lead higher obviously than the then the S&P 500 we think that that that that that's important as well.\nAnd so as a result that will well always have it now I have always had an allocation to fixed income I mean like so that that probably is going to range from 10 to 20% of the portfolio.\nAnd then that you know the the option overlay is an opportunity for us to generate some income it's it's a little bit more tactical there are a few energy stocks out there that we really like.\nWe don't pay in they don't have a significant dividend and so obviously you know option overlay is a way for us to synthetically.\nAnd create some income for for investors and and you know we'd like to write the options for enough out of the money that it gives us opportunity still to capture the upside but also.\nGet some income that that we can ultimately distribute to the investor obviously the other thing that the fixed income and option overlay does a little bit is it helps mitigate some of the volatility that's just inherent in investing inequities in general.\nBut investing in the energy sector as well and so so that's kind of how we we utilize you know all those various tools in our toolbox and and with with the goal of delivering high high returns.\nBut with some income associated with and and try to to limit the volatility of of the underlying of the portfolio as well.\nYeah you mentioned their volatility you know being an active ETF you know that's designed to be flexible.\nIs there any kind of point in time where you will based on market conditions tilt the portfolio to be a little bit more defensive to maybe help mitigate or manage some risk or is the active component more more or less designed to help take advantage of you know longer term opportunities rather than maybe trying to.\nI don't know I don't want to use word play but kind of play around volatility and and market draw down in the energy sectors.\nI think that's a great observation and we actually just have done that most recently if you if you look at.\nYou know what's been happening in the sector you know well prices are down down significantly at least from you know year ago and even even you know from from 2020 they've been they've been declining I guess just in general so I guess the best way to say it.\nWe expect a well prices are probably going to come down a little bit more as well now if you know obviously what does that mean so well you probably don't want to have a lot of exposure to oil and gas producers especially oil producers because you know the income of oil and gas producers tied to the fundamental commodity price and.\nGenerally speaking and you know obviously if you look at some competing products like the XLE there's a lot of oil and gas producers in the XLE.\nOn the other on you know from from our perspective we can position we don't have to be in the the oil and gas producers and we limited our exposure.\nAnd we can be actually an electric utilities which are more defensive in nature but and and that's history and and that's still true but also remember there's a growth story now and and the electric generation sector and electric utilities and and so we see that as an opportunity for us to.\nIn a period of declining commodity prices to actually be a little defensive but also be in an early stage growth story that's really not been fully recognized by the stock market yet.\nSo let's take a look at performance I looked at performance the fun as a one year return of over 40% so first of all congratulations.\nCan you talk about a little bit about one of the key drivers that help propel that return over last year.\nYeah so so what I would say is you have the energy sectors is made people listen as called no and may and may be even share this view has been really under invested and and I think really under appreciated for for a series of years really all the way back to 2020.\nAnd and so as a result energy sector.\nFrom evaluation perspective has been trading that pretty substantial discount for several years to it's it's historical norm and to the broader market last year sector caught up a little bit sector really performed well especially well won't let me say this way.\nWhere you position you did well see so if you're an energy infrastructure electric utilities those stocks didn't really well last year oil and gas producers not not not as well last year and we we were position in energy infrastructure a little bit of electric utilities and those stocks delivered that they delivered because.\nThey continued to grow their cash flow they continued to pay dividends they continued to grow the dividends.\nBut but yet still traded it at pretty significant discounts now this new you know AI really just started we're starting hearing a lot about it really last year right and so.\nInvestors just started to to to to put the connection between okay we're going to need more natural gas we're going to need more electricity generation and started to to factor that in and that growth into to some of these stocks but all that said.\nThe whole energy sector including infrastructure including utilities including while in gas still trades in a discount to where it's traded at historically so even though we've had great performance in in the last year there's still a lot of great opportunities ahead.\nYeah, no I couldn't agree more and one of the things you know your benchmark is yes and p 500 energy index and you know the performance is diverse significantly so.\nI'm a big believer that tracking error is your ability to deliver alpha how do you kind of.\nOr should I say how should investors interpret the difference in results between your fund TPC and your benchmark which is the S&P energy sector or index.\nI think that investor should interpret it as that's why you know active ETF if you're looking for an ETF active ETF makes a ton of sense relative to the passive one I mean obviously the excel we can't it can only do what it can do which is you know it's limited based on on a methodology.\nOur active ETF can identify the future opportunities and where the puck is going in energy and move there and move there quickly and that's and that's that's what we've done and that's really helped us.\nReally propel us and and provide that that that return that excess return over and beyond over and beyond what the index has has delivered.\nSo here's a million dollar question right for someone already has or is building a diversified model portfolio.\nWhat role do you see TPC playing you know should investors view it as a core energy allocation should they look at it is an income generating sleeve or maybe more of an opportunistic position.\nYeah, hold the above.\nYeah, I appreciate that well what I was surprised I think I do think it's a combination of several of us I do think that investors you know you wanted as a core allocation I think I think it's really important to understand.\nNothing in the world works without energy so I mean everything starts with energy you know 98% of the things we do everyday require some form of energy and and so.\nI do think that energy is a core allocation that should be in everybody's portfolio so so I do think it's it's not opportunistic it it's a core holding.\nAnd I also do think that also can provide some income and more income than what you're going to get from any other sector basically in the S&P 500 so.\nI think it's a core holding with some income and now we've got this long term secular trend is mega trend and AI that energy is going to be really essential.\nIn in ensuring that AI develops and and AI is not going to develop without energy and so so I've got all these these stars that are aligning which I think make make make make a good case for energy being a being a a solid core allocation and investor portfolios for for not just a few years but a few decades.\nYeah well Rob I couldn't I couldn't agree with you more seeing that secular trend and and seeing the opportunity I think you guys are very very well positioned and you know.\nFirst of all I really appreciate you spending some time out of your day to talk with me but before I let you go.\nWorking people learn more about tortoise capital and where can they find information on TPC.\nYeah so so we so on our website I think it's tortoise capital dot com we've got a ton of information on TPC it's under our active ETF.\nSection of our website we've got other investment products there that if you're looking for for energy investments we also do a significant amount of insights and I would encourage people to look there we just did a recent insight on on on on the nuclear energy sector we do a bunch of insights we wrote a whole paper white paper about AI and energy.\nAnd and the opportunities there so we've got a lot of great information and insights and we do monthly podcasts to give investors an update on what's going on in the sector so anyway I'd encourage you to go to the to our website it's a lot of great information.\nWell again Rob thank you so much for spending some time with me.\nThank you.\nThank you.\n"}
