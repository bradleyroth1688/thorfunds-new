## Our Story

THOR was born from a simple observation: the investment industry kept failing investors in the same ways, cycle after cycle.

Markets work. The math of long-term investing is sound. But between the theory and the outcome sits a gap — the behavioral gap. Year after year, the Dalbar studies show the same thing: investors consistently earn less than the investments they own. Not because strategies fail, but because people get in their own way.

We set out to build something different. Not another fund promising outperformance. A system designed around how investors actually behave.

## What Makes THOR Different

### Science, Not Just Math

Traditional finance relies on linear math — models that assume markets behave in predictable, orderly ways. They don't.

THOR applies dynamic science — principles from physics and engineering — to solve the non-linear problem of markets. We use digital signal processing (the same technology in noise-canceling headphones) to filter market noise and detect genuine regime changes.

### Rules-Based, Not Discretionary

When emotions run high, discretion fails. THOR's strategies are fully systematic. Every decision is made by the process, evaluated the same way every time, regardless of headlines or sentiment.

### Transparent by Design

We don't hide behind complexity. Our signals are visible. Our methodology is documented. We believe transparency builds trust, and trust is what allows investors to stay invested when it matters most.
