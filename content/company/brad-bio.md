## Background

Early in his career as a portfolio manager, Brad watched intelligent, thoughtful clients make decisions that made no sense if you only looked at the numbers. They sold when they shouldn't have. They waited too long to act when they should have moved. They changed strategies at exactly the wrong moments. And they did all of it with explanations that sounded perfectly reasonable at the time.

The pattern became impossible to ignore: the problem wasn't information, access, or discipline in the traditional sense. The problem was that investment processes were designed as if people behave like machines — and they don't.

After two decades of watching these patterns repeat, Brad stopped trying to fix behavior through education and started building systems designed to work around it.

## Philosophy

**"I've made more money in sweatpants than a suit."**

Brad's approach to investing is built on a simple premise: the market is not the problem. Behavior is. His work focuses on building rules-based systems that remove emotional decision-making from the investment process.

Key beliefs:
- Rules beat intelligence in the long run
- Consistency matters more than cleverness
- Transparency builds the trust that allows investors to stay invested
- We don't predict markets — we detect regime changes
