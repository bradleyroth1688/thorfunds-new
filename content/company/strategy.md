# THOR Investment Strategy

## Core Philosophy

**"We use science, not just math, to react to changes in market cycles in real time."**

Math is linear. Markets are not. Traditional financial models assume orderly behavior that rarely exists in practice. THOR applies dynamic science — principles from physics and engineering — to solve this non-linear problem.

## The Signal Processing Approach

### The Noise-Canceling Analogy

Think about how noise-canceling headphones work. They constantly monitor and sample ambient noise. They "listen" to the noise around you. The headphones utilize digital signal processing to analyze the waveform, then create a soundwave that is exactly opposite to cancel it out.

Constant noises like jet engine hums are easier to recognize and cancel compared to sudden, random sounds like people talking — which is why we must convert our waveforms first to lower the frequency.

**We do the same thing with price data:**

1. **Convert price data to a smooth waveform** — like converting red noise to a low-frequency wave
2. **Apply digital signal processing** — same science as noise-canceling headphones
3. **Detect regime changes** — flip to risk-off at confirmed turning points, not on every wiggle
4. **Stay invested most of the time** — slight long bias, few trades

## Key Investment Arguments

### 1. Missing the Worst Days > Missing the Best Days

Over 85 years, missing the 10 worst days yields $256.46 on $1, versus $80.76 for buy-and-hold, versus $26.79 for missing the 10 best days.

### 2. Volatility Destroys Compounding

Portfolios with the same average return but lower volatility end with higher balances. The math is unforgiving — a 40% loss requires a 67% gain just to break even.

### 3. Diversification Fails When You Need It Most

Risk models work most of the time, except during extreme market stress — exactly when protection matters most.

### 4. Maximum Drawdown > Volatility as a Risk Measure

Standard deviation doesn't capture the real experience of loss. Drawdowns determine whether investors can stay invested.

## Where THOR Excels

- **Downside volatility:** Extreme, quick drawdowns after sustained rallies (Q4 2018, 2020, 2008)
- **Upside reversals:** Market capitulation days near bear market ends
- **Drawdowns >15%:** Signal is well-suited to detect and capitalize on these

## Where THOR Struggles

- **Staircasing markets:** Up 10-15%, down 8-10%, repeat (like elements of 2022-2023)
- **Medium-sized channels:** Up 10%, down 10% repeatedly
- Sweet spot: >15% moves in each direction (great) or <7% moves (fine); mid-range causes chop

## Products

### THLV — Equal Weight Low Volatility ETF

**Strategy:** Evaluates 10 S&P 500 sectors weekly using signal processing. Each sector is either risk-on (own it) or risk-off (remove it).

**Competitive Edge:**
- Only equal-weight low vol ETF Brad is aware of
- Better upside capture than traditional low vol (equal weight vs cap weight)
- Can go 100% cash when all sectors turn risk-off — competitors must stay invested

**Benchmark:** iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (USMV)

### THIR — Index Rotation ETF

**Strategy:** Rotates between SPY (S&P 500), DIA (Dow Jones), and QQQ (Nasdaq 100) based on signal processing.

**Key Mechanic:** When the first index goes risk-off, the other two get reweighted to 50% each — still 100% invested. Cash only enters when the second index goes off.

**Positioning:** Satellite exposure alongside existing long-only equity.

**Benchmark:** SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)

## Rebalance Schedule

- **Evaluated:** Every Monday after close
- **Executed:** Every Wednesday at close (allows time for custom basket creations for ETF tax purposes)

Not quarterly. Not semi-annually. **Weekly.**

## The Technical Process

### True Strength Index (TSI)
Momentum calculation that smooths price movements to highlight underlying trend.

### Ehlers High-Pass Filter
Removes low-frequency components, highlights short-term fluctuations.

### Combined Signal
Captures both momentum (TSI) and cyclical movements (high-pass filter):
- **Buy signals:** Increasing trend + positive momentum
- **Sell signals:** Decreasing trend + negative momentum

## We Don't Predict. We Detect.

Prediction implies knowing the future. Detection implies listening to the present. A prediction says the market will go up or down. A detection says the market's behavior has changed in a way that historically precedes a meaningful move.

One requires being right. The other requires being consistent. Markets reward consistency far more often than cleverness.
