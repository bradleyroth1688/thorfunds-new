# THOR Investment Philosophy

## The Core Truth

**The market is not the problem. Behavior is.**

Every year, Dalbar publishes its Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior. Every year, the conclusion is the same: investors consistently earn less than the investments they own. Not because the investments failed, but because the investors got in their own way.

The gap is persistent, large, and has not closed in over thirty years of measurement. Education didn't fix it. Better products didn't fix it. Technology didn't fix it. More information made it worse.

## Why Traditional Approaches Fail

### Buy-and-Hold Is Incomplete

Buy-and-hold explains how markets generate returns, but not how investors experience them. It assumes investors can tolerate drawdowns without reacting. History suggests otherwise.

**Patience without structure is not discipline. It is hope.**

### Diversification Fails When Needed Most

Risk models work most of the time, except during extreme market stress — exactly when protection matters most. Correlations rise when markets are stressed.

### Intelligence Is Overrated

Intelligence works best when conditions are calm and information is clear. Unfortunately, those are the moments when decisions matter least. The decisions that shape long-term outcomes are made under stress, uncertainty, and emotional pressure.

**Rules beat intelligence because markets are an endurance test.**

## The THOR Approach

### 1. Fewer Decisions

The more frequently an investor is forced to decide, the more opportunities there are for emotion to interfere. THOR's systematic approach reduces decision points to what's necessary.

### 2. Rules-Based Execution

Rules decide in advance what action looks like when emotions are loud and judgment is quiet. They execute the same way every time. That consistency is the advantage.

### 3. Detection Over Prediction

Prediction implies knowing the future. Detection implies listening to the present. A prediction says the market will go up or down. A detection says the market's behavior has changed in a way that historically precedes a meaningful move.

One requires being right. The other requires being consistent.

### 4. Designed for Survivability

A theoretically sound approach that an investor cannot stick with is worse than a mediocre one that they can. The best strategy on paper is irrelevant if it is abandoned under stress.

THOR strategies are designed to be livable — not just mathematically optimal.

## Key Principles

### Accept Discomfort as Part of the Process

Every investment strategy has periods where it looks broken. That is not a flaw. It is the market. Strategies that never experience discomfort do not exist, and if they appear to, the risk is hiding somewhere less obvious.

### Clarity Over Complexity

The most robust investment processes are often boring. They are easy to explain, even if they are not easy to follow. Their strength lies not in cleverness but in clarity.

Clarity reduces decisions. Fewer decisions reduce mistakes.

### Time Horizons Must Match Evaluation Windows

Long-term strategies should be evaluated over long-term windows. Short-term movement should be expected, not judged.

**Benchmarks are reference points, not deadlines.**

### Small Mistakes Compound

The real cost in investing rarely comes from dramatic blowups. It comes from subtle erosion — slightly worse timing, slightly higher turnover, more cash held too long. Each decision feels small. Over time, the cost compounds.

## The Innovation Narrative

Every industry has evolved over the past 70 years:
- 1950s: Rotary phones → Smartphones
- 1990s: Mall shopping → Amazon
- 2000s: Paper maps → GPS navigation

**Investment management?** Still largely using the same frameworks from 1952 (Modern Portfolio Theory).

THOR applies 21st-century science — digital signal processing, regime detection, systematic execution — to a problem the financial industry has largely tried to solve with spreadsheets and willpower.

## What We Believe

1. **Behavior drives outcomes.** Not products, not predictions, not punditry.

2. **Systems scale. Willpower doesn't.** Rules-based approaches can be consistent for decades. Humans cannot.

3. **Transparency builds trust.** Trust is what allows investors to stay invested when it matters most.

4. **The goal is consistency, not cleverness.** Markets reward those who show up every day, not those who occasionally get lucky.

5. **Discomfort is the price of admission.** The investors who succeed are not the ones who avoid pain. They are the ones who planned for it.

## The Bottom Line

Better outcomes do not require brilliance. They require planning, endurance, and restraint. They require the ability to sit still while everything in the environment encourages action.

The investors who win are the ones who finally stop fighting the behavioral gap and build around it.

**Participate. Protect. Prosper.**
