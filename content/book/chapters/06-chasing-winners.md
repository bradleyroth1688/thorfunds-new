# Chapter 6: Chasing Winners: The Timing Problem

If the previous chapter was about leaving a good strategy too early, this one is about arriving at the next one too late. They're related, but the underlying failure is different.

Strategy switching is a patience problem — the investor couldn't wait for their approach to work. Chasing winners is a timing problem — the investor uses recent performance as a signal for future returns. One is about leaving. The other is about arriving. And the timing of arrival is almost always wrong.

Chasing winners feels like common sense.

If something has been working, it must be good. If it has been outperforming, it must be doing something right. Why fight what's clearly working when the evidence is right in front of you?

This logic is clean. It is also one of the most reliable ways investors destroy returns.

Performance is persuasive. It feels objective. Numbers do not argue. When an investment has delivered strong recent returns, confidence follows naturally. When it has lagged, doubt arrives just as quickly.

The problem is that markets do not reward recent success. They reward future outcomes, and the two are often poorly aligned.

**Most investors believe they are chasing quality. In reality, they are chasing timing. And their timing is almost universally terrible.**

Consider a familiar experience. An investor reviews their portfolio at the end of a strong year. One holding stands out. It has outperformed everything else by a wide margin. Articles praise it. Commentators explain why the trend makes sense. Friends mention they own it too.

The investor feels underexposed. Adding feels prudent. The numbers confirm it. The story supports it.

So the position is increased.

Months later, performance cools. Volatility rises. The same holding that felt obvious now feels uncomfortable. The story hasn't changed much, but sentiment has.

This is the emotional arc of performance chasing. Confidence peaks after returns. Doubt peaks after losses. Decisions are made at the extremes.

I watched this play out at scale during the innovation fund mania of 2020-2021. One particular fund — I don't need to name it, you know the one — returned over one hundred and fifty percent in 2020. By early 2021, money was pouring in. Billions of dollars. Investors who had never heard of the fund eighteen months earlier suddenly couldn't live without it. Financial influencers promoted it. Cable news featured its manager constantly.

Most of that money arrived in the first quarter of 2021, near the fund's all-time high. Over the next eighteen months, the fund declined roughly seventy-five percent.

Here's the devastating part. The fund's time-weighted return over its lifetime was actually respectable. But the dollar-weighted return — what the average investor actually earned — was deeply negative. The fund made money. Its investors lost money. Not because the fund failed, but because the investors arrived after the returns had already happened.

This is the timing problem in its purest form. The performance was real. The participation was late. And the gap between the two is where returns go to die.

The pattern plays out at the fund level with depressing consistency. Morningstar has documented this gap for years. They call it the "investor return gap." Across fund categories, the dollar-weighted return that investors actually earned trails the time-weighted return of the fund itself by roughly 1.7 percent per year. That gap exists almost entirely because of timing. Money arrives after strong performance. Money leaves after weak performance. The fund did its job. The behavior didn't.

According to Dalbar's Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior, over the thirty years ending in 2022, the average equity fund investor earned roughly 6.8 percent per year. The S&P 500 returned approximately 9.7 percent over the same period. That gap of nearly three percentage points per year is not explained by fees. It is explained by behavior. Entering late. Exiting early. Arriving with confidence and leaving with regret.

**The most dangerous phrase in investing isn't "this time is different." It's "I should have bought that sooner."**

There is a psychological trap here that is easy to miss. Chasing winners allows investors to avoid responsibility. If something popular underperforms, the failure feels shared. *Everyone* owned it. This pushes investors toward consensus. Unfortunately, consensus tends to be expensive.

Advisors know this dynamic from the other side. The most difficult conversation is not explaining a loss. It is explaining why the portfolio does not own what everyone else seems to own. The client's neighbor is up thirty percent. A colleague at work is bragging about a sector fund. The headline says this is the trade of the decade.

*Why don't we own that?*

It is a simple question. It demands a confident answer. And the honest answer — that chasing what has already worked is how returns get destroyed — never sounds as compelling as the story of easy money. The advisor who holds the line protects the client. The advisor who capitulates feels helpful in the moment and becomes part of the problem.

I tell advisors this: if you're getting the "why don't we own that" call, it's already too late for that trade to work. The call itself is the signal. When your least-sophisticated client is asking about an investment, the smart money has already left the building.

Markets move in cycles. Leadership rotates. Assets that outperform for extended periods tend to attract capital right as their expected returns decline. As capital flows into what has worked, prices rise. As prices rise, future returns are pulled forward. Eventually, expectations outrun reality. Investors arrive late because that is when conviction feels safest.

Chasing winners is not about greed in the dramatic sense. It is about reassurance. It is about wanting confirmation before committing capital. It is about mistaking popularity for safety.

**Markets are most dangerous when they feel easiest.**

This does not mean investors should avoid successful assets or strategies. It means success should be treated with skepticism, not enthusiasm. Strong performance is not a buy signal. It is a signal to ask harder questions. What expectations are now embedded in the price? What happens if those expectations are merely met rather than exceeded?

Most investors do not ask these questions. They ask a simpler one: *Why didn't I own more of this sooner?*

That question rarely leads to good decisions.

The market is not punishing investors for being wrong. It is punishing them for being late.

Once again, the problem is not intelligence or effort. It is behavior.
