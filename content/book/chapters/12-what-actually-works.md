# Chapter 12: What Actually Works: A More Realistic Framework

After everything so far, this chapter should not promise a silver bullet.

There isn't one.

If there were, it would already be arbitraged away, misunderstood, or abandoned the first time it felt uncomfortable. What actually works in investing is far less exciting and far more demanding than most people want.

It works precisely because it is hard to live with.

What works starts with fewer decisions. The more frequently an investor is forced to decide, the more opportunities there are for emotion to interfere. Reducing decision points does not eliminate risk, but it dramatically reduces the likelihood of self-inflicted damage.

**This is why simple frameworks tend to outperform clever ones over time. Not because they are superior in theory, but because they are survivable in practice.**

What works also accepts discomfort as part of the process. Volatility, drawdowns, and periods of underperformance must be planned for. Expecting returns without discomfort is like expecting progress without effort.

The investors who succeed are not the ones who avoid pain. They are the ones who planned for it.

Another critical element is rules — not as constraints, but as protection. Rules decide in advance what action looks like when emotions are loud and judgment is quiet. They define what matters and what does not. When to rebalance. When to stay invested. When to accept underperformance as normal rather than interpret it as a signal to change course.

Rules do not guarantee good outcomes. They make bad outcomes less likely.

What actually works also requires alignment between strategy and behavior. A theoretically sound approach that an investor cannot stick with is worse than a mediocre one that they can. The best strategy on paper is irrelevant if it is abandoned under stress.

This means investors must be honest about themselves. About how much volatility they can tolerate. About how often they will be tempted to intervene. About whether they value comfort or outcomes more.

**Before adopting any approach, ask one question: can I live with this when it doesn't work for eighteen months? If the honest answer is no, the strategy is wrong regardless of its expected return.**

Let me share what I've seen separate the advisors who retain clients from those who churn through them. It's not performance. It's expectation-setting.

The advisors who survive market cycles intact are the ones who, in the first meeting, say something uncomfortable. They say: "There will be a twelve-to-eighteen-month period during our relationship where my approach will look wrong. You'll see other strategies doing better. You'll wonder why you hired me. That period is normal. It is not a signal to leave. If we can agree on that now, we'll both be here to see the other side of it."

That conversation is harder to have than any portfolio construction discussion. It is also worth more to the client's long-term outcome than any fund selection ever made.

What works is consistency across full cycles. Not weeks. Not quarters. Cycles. Most strategies look intelligent at the beginning and foolish in the middle. Few investors make it to the end without interference.

Those who do are rewarded not for being smarter, but for being steadier.

Another overlooked ingredient is automation. Not because machines are smarter, but because they are indifferent. They do not read headlines. They do not feel regret. They do not demand reassurance. Automation removes the temptation to negotiate with the plan in moments of stress.

What actually works also respects time. Compounding is fragile. It depends on continuity. Interruptions matter more than small differences in return. Staying invested through discomfort often matters more than optimizing exposure.

Perhaps most importantly, what works is humility. Markets are larger, faster, and more complex than any individual. The goal is not to outsmart them, but to avoid being outsmarted by yourself.

**Improvement in investing rarely comes from doing more. It comes from doing less, better, and for longer.**

This is the part no one wants to hear.

Better outcomes do not require brilliance. They require planning. They require endurance. They require restraint. They require the ability to sit still while everything in the environment encourages action.

Once again, the market is not the problem. Behavior is.

And the investors who win are the ones who finally stop fighting that fact and build around it.
