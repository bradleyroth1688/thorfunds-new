# Chapter 5: Strategy Switching: The Patience Problem

Most investors don't think of themselves as inconsistent. They think of themselves as adaptive. They respond to new information, update their views, and refine their approach. In a world that changes constantly, flexibility feels like intelligence.

In investing, flexibility is often just another name for impatience.

This chapter is about a specific behavioral failure — the inability to stay committed to a sound approach long enough for it to work. Not chasing the hottest fund. Not reacting to yesterday's returns. Something quieter and more insidious: the slow erosion of conviction that causes investors to abandon a strategy before it completes its cycle.

Strategy switching is a patience problem. The investor chose correctly. They just couldn't wait.

Strategy switching rarely looks reckless in real time. It looks thoughtful and responsible. A strategy underperforms, conditions change, something else looks better, so a switch is made. The logic is clean. The timing is usually terrible. This is how returns quietly disappear.

The average holding period for mutual fund shares has collapsed from roughly eight years in the 1960s to about ten months today. That is not adaptation. That is serial abandonment.

**Every investment strategy has a cost of admission. Strategy switching pays the price at every door and stays for the show at none of them.**

Every investment strategy has periods where it looks broken. That is not a flaw. It is the market. Strategies that never experience discomfort do not exist, and if they appear to, the risk is hiding somewhere less obvious. The problem is not that investors choose bad strategies. It is that they abandon good ones at precisely the wrong moment.

Let me describe what this looks like from the inside. An advisor I work with adopted a risk-managed approach for her clients in 2017. She believed in it. Her clients believed in it. The first two years were fine. Then 2019 happened — one of those years where the S&P 500 went straight up, returning over thirty percent. Her risk-managed strategy returned eighteen percent. By any objective measure, eighteen percent is an excellent year. But her clients didn't see it that way. They saw twelve points of underperformance. They saw their neighbors bragging about index fund returns. They saw what they were missing.

Three clients left in January 2020. They wanted the index. Pure. Unfiltered. No more risk management slowing things down.

Two months later, the pandemic hit. The S&P 500 dropped thirty-four percent. Her remaining clients in the risk-managed strategy were down less than half that. The three who left were fully exposed. Two of them panicked and sold near the bottom.

The strategy didn't fail. Their patience did.

Now picture the full timeline. An investor starts with a growth strategy in 2017. It works well for two years. In late 2019, after hearing about risk management, they shift to a balanced allocation. It holds up during the early 2020 selloff, but misses the sharp recovery. Frustrated, they move to a simple index fund in mid-2021. The index peaks. A bear market arrives in 2022. They rotate into dividend stocks for stability. By late 2023, growth is leading again. They feel behind. The cycle starts over.

Five years. Four strategies. None of them given enough time to work through a full cycle. Each individual decision seemed reasonable. The sequence was devastating. The investor experienced the drawdown of every approach and the full upside of none.

This is the hidden math of strategy switching. It is not just bad timing on one trade. It is a pattern of systematically harvesting the worst periods of every strategy while abandoning each one just before it recovers.

Think of it this way. Every strategy has a cost of admission. For growth strategies, the cost is sharp drawdowns. For value strategies, the cost is long periods of underperformance. For balanced approaches, the cost is never leading the pack. Strategy switching doesn't avoid these costs. It pays the admission price for every strategy and stays for the show at none of them.

There is a cruel timing asymmetry at work. Strategies tend to look most attractive after strong performance, when much of the benefit has already been realized. They tend to look most unattractive after periods of underperformance, when they are often closest to recovery. Strategy switching inverts this relationship. Investors buy what has already worked and sell what has already disappointed.

This is not because they are irrational. It is because discomfort demands resolution.

The psychology here is specific and worth naming: it is the inability to distinguish between a strategy that is failing and a strategy that is in a normal period of underperformance. These feel identical in the moment. Both involve disappointment, doubt, and a nagging question: *is this still working?*

The difference is only visible in retrospect — which is exactly when it's too late.

**Patience is not passive. It is the most active, difficult, and valuable decision an investor makes.**

What makes strategy switching especially destructive is that it rarely feels like panic. Panic is obvious. Strategy switching is subtle. It happens slowly, with spreadsheets and explanations. It happens with good intentions. And it almost always happens too late.

There is also a deeper misunderstanding beneath the behavior. No strategy outperforms all the time. If it did, it would be arbitraged away or become so popular that it stopped working. Periods of underperformance are not evidence of failure. They are evidence that the strategy is different from the index.

Strategy switching also breaks compounding in a way that most investors underestimate. Compounding requires time and continuity. Strategies need room to work through full cycles. Every switch resets the clock. Gains are truncated. Recoveries are missed. Losses are locked in. Each switch feels small. The cumulative effect is large.

**Most investors do not fail because they stick with a bad strategy. They fail because they never stick with a good one long enough.**

Advisors face their own version of this pressure. When a strategy underperforms for eighteen months, clients begin asking questions. Other firms are marketing strategies with better recent numbers. The temptation to switch platforms, models, or managers is real. But advisors who change their investment approach every few years subject their entire book of business to the same resetting problem. The advisor's conviction must survive the client's impatience, and that requires having answered the hard questions in advance.

The solution is not stubbornness. Blind loyalty to a broken approach is not discipline. The solution is commitment with conditions defined *before* the discomfort begins. Before adopting a strategy, investors and advisors must understand what failure looks like and what discomfort feels like. They must know in advance when underperformance is expected and when it signals something genuinely wrong.

Once rules become optional, they cease to be rules. They become suggestions. And suggestions do not survive stress.

Once again, the market is not the problem. Behavior is.
