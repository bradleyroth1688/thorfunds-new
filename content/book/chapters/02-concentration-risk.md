# Chapter 2: Concentration Feels Smart Until It Isn't

Concentration is one of the most seductive ideas in investing. It feels decisive and confident. Why own a little of everything when an investor can own more of what they believe in? Concentration is often associated with conviction and insight. Many of the most celebrated investment stories are built around concentrated bets that worked.

What those stories leave out is how many similar bets did not.

Concentration does not feel risky while it is working. That is precisely what makes it dangerous.

Most investors do not set out to build concentrated portfolios. Concentration tends to develop gradually. A diversified portfolio is established. Certain positions perform well and grow. Others disappoint and are reduced or removed. Over time, the portfolio becomes increasingly reliant on a small number of exposures.

This process does not feel reckless. It naturally happens over time.

There is a version of this happening right now that most investors do not recognize. A client holds an S&P 500 index fund and believes they are diversified across five hundred companies. They are, in name. In practice, a handful of the largest technology stocks can represent thirty-five percent or more of the index. Without buying a single individual stock, the portfolio has become a concentrated bet on one sector. The client did nothing wrong. The market itself created the concentration. And when that sector eventually corrects, the diversified index will not feel diversified at all.

This is accidental concentration at scale, and it is invisible until it hurts.

I had this conversation with an advisor last year that crystallized the problem. His client — successful business owner, mid-fifties — had about seventy percent of his liquid net worth in three technology stocks. Not because he was a tech enthusiast. Because those were the stocks that had grown over the past decade while everything else went sideways. He'd trimmed the losers and let the winners ride. Classic portfolio management, right?

When I asked the advisor what the client's plan was for a tech correction, he said, "He knows it's concentrated. He just doesn't want to sell because of taxes."

So the concentration remained. Not because of conviction. Because of inertia dressed up as tax planning.

That client watched his portfolio drop forty-two percent in the 2022 tech correction. The tax savings were immaterial compared to the wealth destruction. But of course, by the time the pain was acute enough to act, selling meant locking in losses rather than gains. The tax excuse that prevented action in good times became the loss aversion that prevented action in bad times. Concentration created a trap with no comfortable exit.

**The most dangerous portfolio is the one where selling feels too expensive and holding feels too risky.**

As positions grow larger, the emotional stakes increase. Volatility becomes harder to ignore. Price movements feel more consequential. The portfolio stops being a collection of exposures and starts feeling like a single bet.

Concentration amplifies outcomes and emotions simultaneously. Gains feel validating. Losses feel threatening. A diversified portfolio can disappoint quietly. A concentrated one demands attention.

The mathematics of concentration are less forgiving than the narratives suggest. Research by Hendrik Bessembinder at Arizona State University found that just four percent of publicly traded U.S. stocks accounted for all net stock market wealth creation. The majority of individual stocks failed to outperform Treasury bills over their lifetime. Concentration increases exposure to both extreme winners and the far more common underperformers.

The challenge is that this distribution is only clear in hindsight. Before the fact, every investment story feels plausible.

There is also an illusion of control embedded in concentration. Familiarity breeds confidence. Investors believe that understanding a business or sector reduces risk. In reality, knowledge does not protect against valuation changes, macro shifts, regulatory risk, or shifts in sentiment. Consider how many investors were certain about real estate in 2007, certain about energy in 2014, or certain about technology in early 2000.

Markets do not reward understanding. They reward diversification and survival.

Here is another pattern advisors see constantly. A new client arrives with eighty percent of their portfolio in a single stock, usually from a former employer or an inheritance. They know, rationally, that it should be diversified. But selling feels like giving up on something that has defined their financial identity. So they hold. And hold. Until the reason to sell becomes obvious. By then, the damage is done.

I sat across from a woman once who had inherited her father's stock portfolio — almost entirely one utility company he'd worked at for thirty-five years. She knew she should diversify. But selling those shares felt like erasing him. The stock wasn't just money. It was identity. It was memory. And so a financial decision became an emotional anchor.

That's the part the textbooks skip. Concentration isn't always about greed or conviction. Sometimes it's about loyalty, identity, and the stories we attach to what we own.

**Diversification is the only free lunch in investing. Most investors leave it on the table because concentrated positions feel like a choice they made, and selling them feels like admitting they were wrong.**

Concentration itself is not the enemy. Unmanaged concentration is.

There is a meaningful difference between intentional concentration and accidental concentration, between choosing risk deliberately and experiencing drift. Most investors do not cross that line consciously.

Drift is where discipline erodes.

Concentration feels smart while it is working. It feels intolerable when it stops. Without structure, it increases the likelihood of emotionally driven decisions at exactly the wrong time.

Once again, the market is not the problem. Behavior is.
