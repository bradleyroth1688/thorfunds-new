# Chapter 9: Complexity Feels Intelligent Until It Breaks

Complexity has an aura of sophistication.

A portfolio with many moving parts feels thoughtful. Multiple asset classes, alternative strategies, factor tilts, tactical sleeves, and hedges suggest depth and rigor. Complexity looks like effort, and effort feels like intelligence.

In investing, complexity is often just confusion with better marketing.

Simple ideas feel naïve. Complex ones feel safe. If something goes wrong, at least it wasn't obvious. At least it was complicated for a reason.

This mindset quietly undermines results.

Most investors don't seek complexity on purpose. It accumulates over time. A new idea is added to address a perceived risk. Another strategy is layered in to smooth returns. A hedge is introduced to protect against the last drawdown. Each addition makes sense on its own.

Together, they create a system that is difficult to understand, harder to manage, and nearly impossible to stick with.

Here is a scenario any advisor will recognize. A prospective client brings in their portfolio for a review. They have forty-seven holdings spread across six accounts. There are overlapping index funds, three different international strategies, a hedge fund from 2015 that barely trades, two annuities with surrender charges, a handful of individual stocks inherited from a parent, and a cash position that has been sitting there for three years because no one could decide what to do with it.

When asked to explain the overall strategy, the client cannot. Neither could the previous advisor. The portfolio was not built. It accumulated. Each piece was added to solve a problem that felt urgent at the time. No one ever removed anything. Complexity became the default because simplifying required making decisions, and decisions felt risky.

**This is how most complex portfolios come to exist. Not by design, but by addition without subtraction.**

I once sat in a portfolio review where the advisor had to use three separate software systems to show the client their complete picture. Three systems. The client had accounts at four custodians, positions in eight mutual funds that overlapped significantly, two variable annuities, a managed futures allocation he'd forgotten about, and a gold ETF that his brother-in-law recommended in 2011.

Halfway through the presentation, the client looked up and asked: "So... what am I actually invested in?"

Nobody in the room could answer in a single sentence.

That's complexity. Not because each piece was bad, but because the collection had no coherent purpose. It was an archaeological dig of past anxieties, each layer representing whatever scared the client most at the time it was added.

Complexity increases the number of decisions an investor must make. Every component has its own behavior, its own periods of success and failure, and its own explanation for why now is different. As the number of components grows, so does the number of moments where doubt can creep in.

**More knobs mean more opportunities to turn them.**

Complex portfolios fail in a specific way. They do not collapse all at once. They decay slowly through constant adjustment. Pieces are swapped. Allocations are tweaked. Explanations pile up. Confidence erodes.

Eventually, the investor no longer knows what the portfolio is supposed to do.

When stress arrives, complexity offers no guidance. It offers choices. Too many of them. At that point, decisions are driven by emotion rather than design.

Another issue with complexity is that it often masks redundancy. Investors believe they are diversified because they own many things. In reality, many of those things respond to the same underlying forces. Correlations rise when markets are stressed. What appeared diversified in calm periods suddenly moves together.

A crowded portfolio does not guarantee diversification.

There is also a performance problem hidden here. Complex portfolios often dilute conviction. Strong ideas are watered down. Weak ideas linger because removing them requires admitting they never belonged. The result is a collection of average exposures that struggle to excel in any environment.

**Simple strategies are uncomfortable because their success or failure is obvious. Complexity offers cover. That comfort is expensive.**

The most robust investment processes are often boring. They are easy to explain, even if they are not easy to follow. Their strength lies not in cleverness but in clarity.

Clarity reduces decisions. Fewer decisions reduce mistakes.

This does not mean simplicity is always better. It means unnecessary complexity is dangerous. Every added layer should earn its place by improving outcomes or improving behavior. If a component cannot be explained in plain language to a client, there is a good chance it should not be there.

---

Investors rarely fail because their portfolios are too simple. They fail because their portfolios are too complicated to manage under stress.

Once again, the problem is not the market or the tools available. It's behavior interacting with too many choices.

Complexity feels smart until it breaks.
