# Chapter 4: Fees Matter Less Than You Think (And More Than You Want Them To)

Fees are one of the few things in investing that feel concrete. They are visible, measurable, and easy to understand. Lower is better, everyone agrees. Entire investment philosophies have been built around that idea, and in many ways this has been a healthy shift.

For decades, investors paid far too much for far too little. High fees were justified with complexity, mystique, and the promise of outperformance that rarely materialized. Cost mattered then and it still matters now.

But somewhere along the way, fees became the default explanation for every disappointing outcome. If returns were poor, fees must be the reason. If a portfolio lagged, it couldn't possibly be behavior. It had to be cost.

This belief is convenient. It's also incomplete.

Fees matter, but they are not the primary reason most investors fall short of market returns. A one percent fee compounds over time and that drag is real. At the same time, poor timing, emotional decision-making, and abandoning strategies at the wrong moment often impose costs that are far larger and far less visible.

**In real life, behavioral mistakes usually overwhelm fees like a tidal wave overwhelms a leaky faucet.**

There is also an irony here that rarely gets discussed. An obsession with fees can actually make behavior worse.

Consider a familiar situation. An investor notices that one fund in their portfolio charges more than they expected. Maybe it's actively managed. Maybe it's specialized. Either way, the fee suddenly feels offensive. They replace it with something cheaper and feel like they've improved their portfolio.

A year later, the new fund underperforms. The active fund should have been held to deal with the environment. Frustration sets in, not because the strategy is broken, but because they traded a winner to save a few fractions of a percent in fees. Eventually, another change is made.

The fee went down. The churn went up. The portfolio suffered.

Advisors see a version of this that cuts deeper. A long-term client leaves for a low-cost robo-advisor or a competitor offering a lower fee. The savings might amount to thirty or forty basis points a year. On a million-dollar portfolio, that's three or four thousand dollars. It feels significant.

Then a drawdown arrives. The former client has no advisor to call. No one to explain why staying invested matters. No one to absorb the emotional pressure. They sell near the bottom. The behavioral cost of that one decision dwarfs decades of fee savings. But the client never calculates that cost. They only see the fee they're no longer paying.

I watched this happen in real time with an advisor in the Midwest. His most loyal client of twelve years left in 2019 over a twenty-basis-point fee difference. Moved everything to a digital platform. The advisor was crushed but understood. Three months into the 2020 pandemic selloff, the client panicked. No human to talk to. No relationship to lean on. The robo-advisor sent an automated email about "staying the course" with a chart attached. The client sold everything at the bottom.

By the time he called his old advisor — sheepish, apologetic — the market had recovered thirty percent. The twenty-basis-point savings had cost him roughly six years of compounding. He came back. But the portfolio never caught up.

**The cheapest portfolio is the one you don't blow up.**

What's often overlooked is that fees are predictable. Behavior is not. You know exactly what a fund charges. You do not know how you will react when it underperforms, when volatility spikes, or when headlines become alarming. Those reactions are rarely free.

Trading costs, tax consequences, and opportunity costs do not appear as line items, but they compound just as efficiently as fees do. In many cases, they compound faster and larger.

There is also a psychological trap hidden in low fees. Cheap investments feel like a deal. Low costs reduce transaction friction. This encourages activity.

Activity feels productive. It feels engaged. It feels responsible. Unfortunately, activity is often the enemy of returns. The more frequently investors change strategies, rebalance emotionally, or chase what looks better now, the more they interrupt compounding.

A low-cost portfolio that is constantly modified can easily underperform a higher-cost one that is held consistently. This is uncomfortable to admit, especially in an industry that has spent years preaching cost minimization as the ultimate virtue.

**Cost efficiency without behavioral discipline is not an edge. It's just cheaper chaos.**

Ask most investors what they pay in fees and they'll give you an answer down to the basis point. Ask them how much their behavior has cost them and you'll get silence.

Some strategies cost more because they do more. Others cost more because they promise more. These are not the same thing.

Paying a higher fee for something that helps investors stay invested, manage risk, decrease correlation, or avoid destructive behavior can be a net positive. The question isn't whether a fee is high or low. It's whether the strategy justifies its existence through outcomes, not marketing.

The real danger is turning fee minimization into a substitute for thinking. When investors believe cost control alone guarantees success, they stop asking harder questions. How will I behave when this underperforms? What will I do during a drawdown? What is my plan when this feels broken?

Fees don't answer those questions.

Behavior does.

Low fees are a prerequisite, not a solution. They improve the odds, but they don't change the game. The game is still played in the space between your ears.

Once again, the market isn't the problem. And neither are fees.

Behavior is.
