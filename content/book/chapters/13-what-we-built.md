# What We Built: A Note from the Author

Everything in this book comes from the same realization: the problem was never the market. It was always behavior.

I spent years trying to solve that problem the traditional way. Better explanations. Clearer charts. More detailed conversations about risk and time horizons. I assumed that if clients and advisors understood the patterns described in these chapters, they would stop repeating them.

They didn't. Neither did I.

Knowing that emotion drives bad decisions does not stop emotion from driving bad decisions. Understanding the cost of strategy switching does not prevent the next switch. Recognizing that volatility is not risk does not make a thirty percent drawdown feel survivable in the moment.

Education is necessary. It is not sufficient. That is the uncomfortable conclusion of everything in this book. If knowing better were enough, the gap between market returns and investor returns would have closed decades ago. It hasn't. Not because people are stupid. Because they are human.

After two decades of watching these patterns repeat — in my clients, in advisors I worked with, and honestly in myself — I stopped trying to fix behavior and started building systems designed to work around it.

The idea was borrowed from a field that has nothing to do with finance: signal processing. Think about how noise-canceling headphones work. They constantly sample ambient sound, analyze the waveform, and create an opposite signal to cancel out the noise — so you only hear the music. We built something similar for markets. Instead of reacting to every headline, every price swing, every burst of volatility, the system filters noise to find the structural trend underneath. When the character of the market actually changes, the system detects it and repositions. When it's just noise, it stays the course.

We don't predict. We detect. That distinction matters.

Prediction implies knowing the future. Detection implies listening to the present. A prediction says the market will go up or down. A detection says the market's behavior has changed in a way that historically precedes a meaningful move. One requires being right. The other requires being consistent. Everything in this book argues that consistency wins.

No predictions. No gut calls. No emotional overrides. Just a process that does the same thing every time, regardless of how the market feels.

This is what became THOR Financial Technologies.

We built two strategies around this framework. THLV, our Equal Weight Low Volatility ETF, applies signal processing at the sector level — monitoring ten sectors and rotating into those where the trend is favorable, stepping aside from those where it isn't. When a sector's signal turns negative, the system removes it. When conditions deteriorate across the board, it can move entirely to cash. No committee meeting. No gut check. Just the data.

THIR, our Index Rotation ETF, applies the same philosophy at the index level — rotating between the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq based on which index the data favors. When none of them favor participation, it steps to cash entirely. Not because it predicted a crash, but because the data said the character of the market had changed. When the data changes again, the system repositions. Automatically. Without a single anxious phone call.

Both are systematic. Both are rules-based. Both are designed to do what this entire book argues investors should do: stay invested when the data supports it, reduce exposure when it doesn't, and never let emotion make the call.

Are they perfect? No. No system is. There are environments where they struggle — choppy, trendless markets that whipsaw any trend-following approach. I am honest about that because self-awareness is more valuable than marketing.

But they are consistent. And consistency is what this book has been about from the first page.

I did not write this book to sell a product. I wrote it because these patterns — the ones that quietly destroy returns — are real and persistent and I've watched them hurt too many people. The diagnosis matters on its own. But I would be dishonest if I didn't mention that the diagnosis is what led me to build the treatment.

If the ideas in this book resonate, I write about them regularly in *The Signal*, a free newsletter where I share what the system is seeing, how we're positioned, and why — without the noise. You can subscribe at our website.

One more thing worth mentioning. We made the signal available to everyone. The same signal processing technology that drives our ETFs is accessible to any investor through THOR Signals at **thorsignals.com**. This is not a black box. We are not hiding the process behind a wall and asking people to trust us blindly. That would contradict everything in this book. If rules and transparency beat discretion and mystery, then the system should be open. So it is.

This book is the why. What we built is the how. And we made sure anyone can see it working.
