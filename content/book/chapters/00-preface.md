# Preface: Why This Book Exists

I didn't set out to write a book about investing behavior. I set out to build portfolios that worked and to help financial advisors explain them in a way clients could actually live with.

Like most people in this industry, I started with the math. Models, diversification, asset allocation, expected returns. If you put the right pieces together and give them time, the outcome should take care of itself. On paper, it almost always did.

In real client portfolios, it rarely did.

Early in my career as a portfolio manager, I watched intelligent, thoughtful clients make decisions that made no sense if you only looked at the numbers. They sold when they shouldn't have. They waited too long to act when they should have moved. They changed strategies at exactly the wrong moments. And they did all of it with explanations that sounded perfectly reasonable at the time.

Advisors will recognize this immediately. The calls come after drawdowns. The emails arrive after a stretch of underperformance. The questions aren't really about the strategy. They're about discomfort. At first, I assumed the issue was education. Maybe volatility wasn't being explained clearly enough. Maybe expectations weren't set properly. Maybe the solution was better charts, better meetings, better language.

So I explained more.

It didn't help.

Over time, the pattern became impossible to ignore. The problem wasn't information. It wasn't access. It wasn't even discipline in the way the industry usually defines it. The problem was that the investment process was designed as if people behave like machines, and neither clients nor advisors do.

I've seen this from both sides of the table. I've felt the urge to protect gains when markets were calm and reduce risk when things felt uncertain. I've second-guessed good decisions because they were temporarily uncomfortable. I've watched strategies I believed in look broken long before they ultimately worked. Experience does not eliminate these instincts. It just makes you more aware of them.

As my practice grew and I worked with more advisors and more clients, the same mistakes repeated themselves with remarkable consistency. Different markets. Different products. Different personalities. Same outcomes. The gap between theory and reality didn't shrink with experience. It became clearer.

That's when it became obvious that this gap isn't a flaw in investing. It's the defining feature of it.

The numbers confirm this. Every year, Dalbar publishes its Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior. Every year, the conclusion is the same: investors consistently earn less than the investments they own. Not because the investments failed, but because the investors got in their own way. The gap is persistent, it is large, and it has not closed in over thirty years of measurement. Education didn't fix it. Better products didn't fix it. Technology didn't fix it. More information made it worse.

Most investment advice stops at the point where things become difficult. It explains what should work, but not how to stick with it when it doesn't feel like it is. Buy and hold is offered as a solution without acknowledging that it demands behavior most people cannot sustain without structure. Diversification is praised without discussing how it feels during long periods of underperformance. Risk is defined mathematically while being experienced emotionally by both clients and the advisors responsible for guiding them.

I've seen portfolios fail not because the strategy was wrong, but because the client couldn't live with it or the advisor couldn't keep committed to it. I've also seen unremarkable strategies succeed because they were designed in a way that made them survivable. Clear rules. Honest expectations. Fewer opportunities to interfere.

That difference is what this book is about.

I wrote this for financial advisors who are tired of having the same conversations every cycle and for clients who are tired of feeling like they're the problem. It's for people who have done the right things, avoided obvious mistakes, and still feel like outcomes fall short of what the plan promised. It's for anyone who has looked back at a decision and thought, *I knew better at the time.*

This is not a book about beating the market. It's about helping advisors and clients capture what the market already offers without getting in their own way.

If there's a single idea running through these pages, it's this: better outcomes come from understanding behavior first and building investment processes around it, not the other way around.

The market is hard. Investing doesn't have to be harder than it already is.
