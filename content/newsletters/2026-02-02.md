# The Signal — Monday, February 2, 2026

## Market Pulse

January is in the books, and the scoreboard doesn't lie.

**Friday's Close:**
| Index | Close | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 | 6,939.03 | -0.43% |
| Dow 30 | 48,892.47 | -0.37% |
| Nasdaq | 23,461.82 | -0.94% |
| Russell 2000 | 2,613.74 | -1.55% |

The week ended softly — Nasdaq down nearly 1%, small caps off 1.5% — but the real story is the month, not the day. The VIX spiked 13% to 19.11 on Friday, and yields ticked higher (10-year at 4.24%, 30-year nudging 4.87%).

**This morning:** Futures are pointing to a mildly positive open. S&P futures +0.2%, Nasdaq futures +0.8% (attempting a bounce after Friday's tech-led weakness). Dow futures are essentially flat.

**Overseas:** Asia was broadly negative overnight. Nikkei -1.25%, Hang Seng -2.2%, and Korea's KOSPI got crushed — down 5.3%. Europe is flat. Not exactly a warm welcome for February.

**Commodities:** Crude oil fell 4.6% to $62.21 — something to watch given energy's YTD dominance. Natural gas collapsed 15.8%. Gold steady around $4,735. Silver popped 4.2%.

## The THOR View

**January's Final Sector Scoreboard Tells the Whole Story**

If you want to understand where we are, forget the S&P headline number. Look underneath:

| Sector | January YTD Return |
|--------|-------------------|
| Energy | **+12.24%** |
| Materials | **+11.25%** |
| Industrials | **+7.84%** |
| Consumer Staples | **+7.10%** |
| Communication Services | +3.48% |
| Utilities | +3.23% |
| Consumer Discretionary | +2.78% |
| Real Estate | +2.40% |
| Healthcare | -0.34% |
| Financials | **-1.51%** |
| Technology | **-2.05%** |

Read that again. Energy stocks gained 12% in January while tech *lost* 2%. That's a 14-percentage-point spread. In one month.

This is the rotation THOR's system detected before it became obvious. THLV moved Tech, Financials, and Real Estate to risk-off *before* they became the laggards. It didn't predict this — it detected the character change in these sectors' price data and acted.

The S&P 500 is only up 1.69% YTD, but remember — the S&P is 29% technology. That's a massive anchor. An equal-weight approach that avoids sectors in downtrends doesn't carry that anchor. That's not a theory. That's what THLV is doing right now.

Same story at the index level. THIR has Nasdaq essentially off and is running 50/50 between the Dow and S&P. When 60% of the Nasdaq is technology and technology is negative YTD, the rotation math is straightforward.

One nuance worth flagging: oil fell 4.6% on Friday. If energy prices continue to slide, the sector leadership could get tested. The system will tell us if and when that happens. That's the point — we don't have to guess. We just have to listen to The Signal.

## One Thing to Watch

**ISM Manufacturing at 10:00 AM ET**

The consensus expects 48.4% (still contractionary, but improving from 47.9%). Manufacturing has been in and out of contraction for two years now — another below-50 print won't shock anyone. But watch the details: new orders, prices paid, and employment sub-indices matter more than the headline.

The bigger picture: this is **jobs week**. Wednesday brings ADP. Thursday is jobless claims. And Friday is the main event — the January employment report (consensus: 55,000 new jobs, unemployment holding at 4.4%). Last month's hot PPI reading already put the Fed in a wait-and-see posture. If jobs come in strong Friday, rate-cut expectations get pushed further out. If they disappoint, the conversation changes fast.

The data will tell us. Stay tuned.
