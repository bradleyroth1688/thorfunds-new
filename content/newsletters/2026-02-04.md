# The Signal — Wednesday, February 4, 2026

## Market Pulse

**Futures are trying to stabilize this morning after tech took a beating yesterday — S&P 500 futures up 0.13%, Dow futures up 0.29%, Nasdaq 100 futures flat.** That "flat" on the Nasdaq says everything. Nobody's rushing back into the names that got hit.

**Tuesday's close:**
| Index | Close | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 | 6,917.81 | -0.84% |
| Dow 30 | 49,240.99 | -0.34% |
| Nasdaq Comp. | 23,255.19 | -1.43% |

**The story isn't just "tech down."** It's specifically *why* tech is down. Anthropic's Claude Cowork agent — launched Friday — is forcing markets to reprice entire business models in real time. Salesforce dropped 7%. ServiceNow dropped 7%. Adobe, Datadog, and a roster of enterprise software names are all in the red. European equivalents are getting hit even harder — LSEG, RELX, and Wolters Kluwer are posting double-digit declines across two sessions. As one strategist put it: "Anthropic is parking its tanks on their lawn."

Tech was the worst S&P 500 sector yesterday, down 2.2%. Energy was the best, up 3.3%. That's a 5.5% sector spread in a single day. Rotation doesn't whisper. It shouts.

**Gold's recovery is the other headline.** After last week's Warsh-induced plunge — gold fell 13% in two sessions — the metal is staging a massive comeback. Gold is at $5,081 this morning, up 3% overnight, and up 9% over the past two days. That's the biggest two-day gain since late 2008. Silver is back near $90, up 5%. This isn't a structural turn yet — it's a market finding its footing after panic selling. But the speed of the rebound tells you the Warsh selloff overshot.

**The rest of the board:**
- **Oil:** Brent $67.20 (-0.2%), but supported after the U.S. shot down an Iranian drone near the carrier Abraham Lincoln and gunboats approached a U.S.-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran tensions are real and persistent.
- **Bitcoin:** $76,270 — languishing near its lowest since November 2024. The Warsh nomination is weighing heavily on crypto.
- **VIX:** 18 (up from 16.25 Monday, hit 20.37 intraday yesterday before settling)
- **10Y yield:** ~4.30% (dipped as traders digest Warsh policy implications)

**After-hours movers:** AMD fell 7% after its Q1 forecast disappointed. Chipotle dropped 6% on falling traffic for the fourth straight quarter. Match Group jumped 7% on a big cash flow beat. Super Micro surged 6% post-report.

**Overseas:** Europe is mixed — STOXX 600 dipping from record highs, dragged by Novo Nordisk (-18% on a bleak 2026 outlook) and the software selloff. FTSE 100 bucked the trend, up 0.5%, boosted by oil and healthcare. Asian markets were choppy.

## The THOR View

**Let's be direct: the AI disruption trade just went from theoretical to operational, and THOR's positioning was already there.**

When Anthropic launched Claude Cowork's plugins on Friday, the market didn't react immediately. By Tuesday, it did — with force. Enterprise software companies that sell data analytics, professional services, and workflow automation saw billions in market cap evaporate in 48 hours. This isn't about one product launch. It's about the market suddenly processing what happens when AI agents can do what those companies charge annual subscriptions for.

Here's what matters for THOR: **QQQ is off in THIR. XLK is off in THLV.** Both signals were generated by the system before Claude Cowork launched. The system detected tech weakness in the trend data — not because it predicted an Anthropic product launch, but because the underlying price dynamics were already deteriorating. That's the distinction between detecting and predicting.

THIR is running 50/50 Dow and S&P. Yesterday the Dow touched a new record at 49,653 before the broader market rolled over. The S&P lost less than 1%. The Nasdaq lost 1.4%. When you're not in the Nasdaq, you're not eating the loss that matters most. The rotation out of tech concentration and into broader market exposure has been the dominant trade for weeks. The system positioned for it.

THLV's 7-of-10 sectors risk-on is equally telling. The sectors that are ON — Energy, Industrials, Materials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Utilities — are exactly the sectors benefiting from rotation. Energy led the S&P yesterday (+3.3%) while Tech brought up the rear (-2.2%). When your system overweights the best sector and avoids the worst, the positioning speaks for itself.

**On gold's bounce:** We said yesterday this was a reversion, not a trend change. Two days later, gold is back above $5,000. That's fast. The Warsh-induced crash was violent but the speed of recovery suggests the structural demand story (central banks, geopolitics, dollar diversification) hasn't broken. We're watching for the signal — not reacting to the noise.

## One Thing to Watch

**Alphabet Reports Tonight**

Google's parent company reports Q4 earnings after the bell — expected to post EPS of $2.64 on revenue of $111.5B. The AI capex number is the one the market cares about. If Google shows that AI is growing its cloud business and expanding margins (expected at 39.1%), it could steady the tech selloff narrative for a session.

But here's the nuance: Alphabet's report answers "can big tech benefit from AI?" The Claude Cowork selloff answers a different question — "does AI make enterprise software companies obsolete?" Those are not the same question. A strong Google quarter doesn't save Salesforce's business model.

Also on the calendar: ADP employment data, Eli Lilly earnings, Qualcomm results. Novo Nordisk already reported in Europe — down 18% on a grim 2026 outlook. Weight-loss drug growth is decelerating faster than expected.

The market is juggling three narratives simultaneously: AI disruption (tech rotation), Warsh at the Fed (commodity volatility), and geopolitics (Iran tensions supporting oil). The system doesn't try to untangle all three. It reads the price data and positions accordingly. Right now, the data says: own the broad market, avoid tech concentration, stay deployed.
