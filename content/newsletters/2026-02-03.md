# The Signal — Tuesday, February 3, 2026

## Market Pulse

**S&P 500 futures are pointing to another green open this morning — up 0.1% to 7,010, flirting with record territory for a second straight session.** Nasdaq futures lead, up 99 points (+0.4%), as Palantir's monster Q4 earnings reignite enthusiasm for the AI trade. The Dow is the one laggard, down 53 points, while Russell 2000 futures are essentially flat.

**Monday's rally:**
| Index | Close | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 | 6,976.44 | +0.54% |
| Dow 30 | 49,407.66 | +1.05% |
| Nasdaq 100 | 25,738.61 | +0.73% |
| Russell 2000 | 2,640.28 | +1.02% |

**The precious metals story is impossible to ignore.** Gold just surged $266 to $4,919 (+5.7%) — a massive bounce after last week's historic plunge. Silver is up 11.8% to $86. Before you get excited: this is a reflex bounce after an extraordinary selloff, not a new trend. The system distinguishes between bounce and regime. So should you.

**The rest of the board:**
- **Oil:** $62.18 (flat)
- **Bitcoin:** Bouncing ~4% after a brutal week
- **10Y yield:** 4.289% (+1 bp)
- **VIX:** 16.25 (-0.6%) — markets aren't worried

**Overseas:** Japan's Nikkei was the global standout, surging 3.9%. Shanghai rallied 1.3%. Europe is mixed and mostly flat (DAX +0.2%, FTSE -0.2%).

**Earnings spotlight:** Palantir crushed it — Q4 beat with FY2026 revenue guidance of $7.2B vs. the Street's $6.2B estimate. Disney beat on parks and streaming. PepsiCo beat on global beverage sales. Not everyone's winning: AMD dipped 1.6% and Oracle fell 3% after a $50B fundraising announcement.

## The THOR View

**Two data points frame everything this morning.**

First: the S&P 500 is up about 2% year-to-date. The Russell 2000 is up over 6%. That's a 4-point gap in barely a month, and it's telling you the same thing THIR's signals detected before it became consensus — this isn't a mega-cap-tech-dominated tape anymore.

THIR remains positioned 50/50 Dow and S&P with Nasdaq essentially off. When the broadest measure of market breadth is outperforming the tech-heavy index by 3x, the system's positioning makes sense. It's not a prediction — it's what the data is showing.

Second: sector divergence keeps widening. THLV has 7 of 10 sectors risk-on, with Tech, Financials, and Real Estate off. Monday reinforced the trade: Consumer Staples led (+1.6%), Financials gained ground (+1.0%), while Energy pulled back (-2.0%). The system's equal-weight approach across active sectors means no single name or sector dominates the return profile.

**On the gold bounce:** A $266 move sounds dramatic. It is dramatic. But context matters — gold plunged from above $4,900 to the low $4,600s last week. Today's bounce brings it back near where it was a week ago. That's a reversion, not a breakout. We detect structural turns, not reflexive bounces. Big difference.

**On Palantir and the AI trade:** One company's earnings don't change the tech sector's trend data. Palantir's guidance was genuinely impressive ($7.2B vs. $6.2B expected), and Nasdaq futures are responding. But the system evaluates the broad sector signal, not individual names. Tech (XLK) remains risk-off until the data says otherwise.

*Running 50/50 Dow and S&P with Nasdaq turned off. The rotation continues to vindicate this positioning.*

## One Thing to Watch

**Friday's January Jobs Report**

This is the week's main event. Consensus expects 55,000 new jobs with unemployment holding at 4.4%. A strong print pushes rate-cut expectations further out and keeps pressure on rate-sensitive sectors — which is another way of saying XLRE staying off makes sense if the labor market is still hot.

But here's the wrinkle: Trump's Fed pick is also coming this week. If the nomination signals a more dovish Federal Reserve, it could change the interest rate calculus entirely — regardless of what Friday's number says. Two forces, potentially pulling in opposite directions. The data will tell us which one wins.

Watch both. Act on neither until the signals confirm.
