# THOR Market Brief — January 31, 2026

**Subject:** 📊 THOR Market Brief: January's Over — The Rotation Nobody Repositioned For

---

### Market Pulse

January closed with the S&P at 6,939, down 0.43% on the day. Nasdaq off nearly a percent, small caps down 1.55%. The headline indexes look fine year-to-date but the composition has changed dramatically. Technology is negative on the year. Energy is up over 12%. Industrials up almost 8%. And gold just had its worst day in years -- down 11% in a single session, silver off 31%. When the "safety trade" gets hit that hard, institutional money is telling you something about how risk is being repriced.

### The THOR View

The most important chart in January isn't the S&P. It's the sector dispersion underneath it. A standard S&P 500 allocation puts roughly 35% of your portfolio in Technology right now. Our THLV system -- which evaluates all 10 sectors weekly based on trend and volatility data -- currently has Technology at 0.54%. Not because we're making a bearish call on tech. Because the data says the trend isn't there right now.

What does have a trend? Materials, Energy, Industrials, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Utilities, Consumer Discretionary -- all equally weighted between 12-15%. Seven of ten sectors risk-on. Three off. That's not a prediction. It's what the price data is showing this week. It can change next week if the data changes. That's the point.

Meanwhile THIR is running 50/50 Dow and S&P 500 with Nasdaq essentially turned off -- same thesis expressed at the index level. When 60% of the Nasdaq is tech and tech isn't trending, the rotation math is straightforward.

### Signal Watch

**THLV — Sector Positioning:**
🟢 Materials (XLB) 15.0%
🟢 Energy (XLE) 14.6%
🟢 Industrials (XLI) 14.4%
🟢 Consumer Disc (XLY) 14.1%
🟢 Consumer Staples (XLP) 14.0%
🟢 Healthcare (XLV) 13.2%
🟢 Utilities (XLU) 12.6%
🔴 Technology (XLK)
🔴 Financials (XLF)
🔴 Real Estate (XLRE)

**THIR — Index Positioning:**
🟢 Dow Jones (DIA) 49.0%
🟢 S&P 500 (SPY) 48.5%
🔴 Nasdaq 100 (QQQ)

Next week's jobs report could accelerate or stall this rotation. Watching breadth divergence between large-cap growth and the rest of the market.

### One Thing to Watch

Month-end rebalancing flows hit Monday. Don't overreact to the noise. The bigger question is whether this sector leadership change sustains through February or whether tech finds a bid. The system will tell us. Ten-year at 4.24% isn't giving fixed income investors much to work with, which means the sector allocation question in equities matters more than usual.
