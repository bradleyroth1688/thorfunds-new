# The Signal — Thursday, February 5, 2026

## Market Pulse

**Futures are trying to find their footing after a second straight day of tech liquidation — S&P 500 futures up 0.16%, Nasdaq 100 futures up 0.30%, Dow futures down 0.09%.** That Dow slippage is notable. After two days of relative outperformance, the rotation trade is pausing to digest a wall of earnings and economic data.

**Wednesday's close:**

| Index | Close | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 | 6,882.72 | -0.51% |
| Dow 30 | 49,501.30 | +0.53% |
| Nasdaq Comp. | 22,904.58 | -1.51% |

**The headline is Alphabet — but the real story is what the market did with it.** Google's parent beat on every line that matters. Revenue: $113.8 billion (beat $111.4B estimates). Annual revenue crossed $400 billion for the first time. Cloud was strong. Margins expanded. And the stock is down 2.4% pre-market. Why? Because Alphabet told Wall Street it plans to spend $175-185 billion on AI capex in 2026 — roughly 50% more than the $119.5 billion analysts expected. The market heard "beat" and then heard "$180 billion" and decided the second number mattered more.

**But here's the bifurcation worth watching.** Nvidia is up 2.3% pre-market. Broadcom is up 5.7%. Someone's spending $180 billion on chips and data centers, and the companies that make those chips are thrilled. The AI trade isn't dead — it's restructuring. Money is leaving the companies AI might replace and flowing to the companies building AI infrastructure. That's not a selloff. That's a repricing.

**The semiconductor picture is more nuanced than the Nvidia pop suggests.** Qualcomm dropped 10.4% after-hours on weak Q2 guidance — a global memory shortage is constraining their outlook. ARM slid 7% on a licensing revenue miss. AMD got destroyed 17% on Wednesday despite beating estimates, because Q1 guidance wasn't high enough for the current bar. The market is making brutal distinctions within tech: are you an AI beneficiary, or are you getting repriced by AI?

**Bitcoin is cracking.** The world's largest cryptocurrency briefly broke below $70,000 overnight — its lowest since November 2024. This isn't a dip. Bitcoin is down over 30% from its highs, with no catalyst for stabilization in sight. The Warsh nomination continues to weigh on risk assets, and crypto is bearing the brunt. The "crisis of faith" language showing up in analyst notes this morning is dramatic, but when $70K breaks, it's the kind of level that forces liquidations.

**The rest of the board:**

- **Gold:** ~$4,970 (Wed close +0.7%), continuing its recovery from the Warsh-induced crash last week. Still well below the $5,625 peak from January 29.
- **Oil (WTI):** $64.50 (+2% Wednesday), supported by Middle East tensions and the energy rotation trade. Energy was the best S&P sector again.
- **10Y yield:** 4.28%, ticked higher as traders weigh inflation stickiness.
- **Dollar:** Index at 97.66, hovering near four-year lows.
- **VIX:** ~18, elevated but not panicked.

**Movers to note:** Eli Lilly surged 10% — revenue up 45% in 2025 to $65.18B, forecast above expectations — while rival Novo Nordisk fell 6% on a grim 2025 outlook and potential sales declines in 2026. The GLP-1 trade is picking winners and losers. Enphase Energy exploded 39% higher. Super Micro jumped 14%. Silicon Labs was acquired by Texas Instruments for $7.5B, shares +50%.

**On deck today:** Amazon reports after the close — the most-watched earnings left this week. Also: weekly jobless claims, Bank of England and ECB rate decisions. The Fed's Lisa Cook said last night that inflation progress "essentially stalled" in 2025, with core PCE estimated at 3.0%. That's not the Fed signal markets want to hear.

## The THOR View

**The market is doing our work for us right now. And that's not luck — that's what systematic investing looks like when the rotation is real.**

Let's put numbers on it. Over the past two sessions: the Dow is up roughly 0.2% combined. The S&P 500 is down about 1.3%. The Nasdaq is down nearly 3%. The equal-weighted S&P 500 gained 0.9% on Wednesday alone. Small caps are rallying. Value is beating growth for the fifth straight session.

THIR is 50/50 Dow and S&P with Nasdaq off. Over these two days, that positioning has outperformed a Nasdaq-heavy portfolio by roughly 300 basis points. That's not marginal. That's the difference between being frustrated and being fine.

The Alphabet earnings are instructive. Google beat expectations and the stock fell. Why? Because the market is no longer rewarding "AI potential" — it's demanding "AI returns." When a company says it'll spend $180 billion on AI infrastructure and you can't yet model the revenue from that spend, the stock goes down. That's rational. What's irrational is owning a tech-heavy portfolio in an environment where the market is punishing exactly this kind of uncertainty.

THLV's positioning continues to shine. Healthcare — our sixth-largest sector holding — got an Eli Lilly tailwind (+10%). Energy remains on a tear. Industrials are steady. Materials are working. The seven sectors we own are exactly the sectors investors are rotating *into*. The three we avoid — Tech, Financials, Real Estate — are the dead weight.

**On bitcoin:** We don't hold crypto and we're not a crypto commentary shop. But the $70,000 break matters because of what it signals about risk appetite. When bitcoin drops 30% from its highs and breaks a widely-watched support level, it tells you something about the willingness to own speculative assets. That aligns with what we're seeing in equities — money is moving from speculation to substance. The rotation trade has legs.

**What we're watching:** Amazon's report tonight could either stabilize or accelerate the tech rout. If Amazon shows that AI is driving AWS margin expansion (like Google showed in Cloud), it supports the "infrastructure winners" narrative. If guidance disappoints, the rotation out of tech concentration accelerates further. Either way, THIR's current positioning — no Nasdaq exposure — means we're watching from a position of strength, not anxiety.

## Signal Watch

**THOR Risk Gauge: 8 — Bullish**

*Broad market participation remains strong. The rotation away from tech concentration is actually a healthy signal for the overall market. Seven of ten sectors trending risk-on, both DIA and SPY confirmed. The system is deployed and positioned for exactly this environment.*

**THIR — Index Rotation ETF** (as of 1/30/26)

| Index | Ticker | Weight | Signal |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Dow Jones | DIA | 49.02% | 🟢 RISK ON |
| S&P 500 | SPY | 48.48% | 🟢 RISK ON |
| Nasdaq 100 | QQQ | 0.53% | 🔴 RISK OFF |
| Cash | BIL | 0.93% | — |

*50/50 Dow and S&P, no Nasdaq. This is the third straight day where the Dow-heavy positioning has outperformed a Nasdaq-heavy allocation. The Dow gained 0.53% Wednesday while the Nasdaq lost 1.51%. That's a 200 bps spread in a single session from index selection alone.*

**THLV — Sector Rotation ETF** (as of 1/30/26)

| Sector | Ticker | Weight | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Materials | XLB | 14.97% | 🟢 RISK ON |
| Energy | XLE | 14.58% | 🟢 RISK ON |
| Industrials | XLI | 14.41% | 🟢 RISK ON |
| Consumer Disc. | XLY | 14.08% | 🟢 RISK ON |
| Consumer Staples | XLP | 14.02% | 🟢 RISK ON |
| Healthcare | XLV | 13.20% | 🟢 RISK ON |
| Utilities | XLU | 12.63% | 🟢 RISK ON |
| Technology | XLK | 0.54% | 🔴 RISK OFF |
| Financials | XLF | 0.42% | 🔴 RISK OFF |
| Real Estate | XLRE | 0.00% | 🔴 RISK OFF |

*Seven sectors risk-on, three off. The system turned off Tech before AI disruption became the dominant market narrative. Energy and Healthcare — the second and sixth largest THLV holdings — were the two best S&P sectors on Wednesday. You don't need to predict the rotation. You need a system that detects it.*

## One Thing to Watch

**Amazon Reports After the Close**

Amazon is the final Magnificent Seven report this week, and it carries outsize weight given the current environment. The street expects EPS of ~$1.86 on revenue of ~$197B. But the numbers that matter are AWS growth and AI capex guidance.

Here's the setup: Alphabet just showed that Cloud revenue is growing while it ramps AI spending. Microsoft showed similar dynamics with Azure last week. If Amazon's AWS tells the same story — AI is driving cloud acceleration — the "AI infrastructure" trade solidifies and chipmakers keep running. If AWS growth decelerates or capex guidance shocks to the upside without clear revenue justification, the market will punish it like it punished Alphabet.

Meanwhile, the Bank of England and ECB both announce rate decisions today. Neither is expected to move, but the tone from both central banks matters. The Fed's Lisa Cook flagged last night that U.S. inflation essentially stalled in 2025 with core PCE at 3.0%. If European central banks echo that caution, it reinforces the "higher for longer" narrative globally.

The system doesn't predict Amazon's earnings or central bank decisions. It positions for what the data is showing. Right now, the data says: broad market strength, tech rotation, stay deployed, avoid concentration. Whatever Amazon says tonight, that framework doesn't change until the data changes. That's the point.
