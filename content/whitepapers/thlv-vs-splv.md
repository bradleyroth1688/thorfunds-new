# Rethinking Low Volatility: Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short

**THOR Equal Weight Low Volatility ETF (THLV) vs. SPLV**

*Research & Strategy | 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Low-volatility ETFs were built on an appealing premise: own the least volatile stocks, sleep better at night. In practice, the largest — Invesco's SPLV — carries structural flaws that undermine that very promise. It concentrates over half its portfolio in just three sectors and can't raise a dollar of cash when markets break down. In March 2020, SPLV didn't just fail to protect investors — it lost *more* than the S&P 500.

## How THLV Works

THLV evaluates 10 S&P 500 sector SPDRs every week using proprietary signal processing — think noise-canceling technology applied to price data. Each sector is either **risk-on** (own it) or **risk-off** (remove it). The portfolio operates in three modes:

### Full Offense (6–10 sectors risk-on)
- 10–20% equal weight per sector
- 0% Cash

### Selective (5 sectors at threshold)
- 20% max weight per sector
- 0% Cash

### Defensive (Fewer than 5 sectors on)
- 20% cap per sector — rest to T-Bills
- Up to 100% Cash

**The Key Mechanic:** When a sector's trend turns negative, THLV removes it and spreads the weight equally across the remaining sectors. This continues until five sectors remain at 20% each — that's the cap. If a sixth sector turns off, THLV moves that 20% into short-duration U.S. Treasuries. Each additional sector going off raises another 20% tranche to cash. If every sector turns negative, the fund is 100% in T-Bills.

**Evaluation:** Every Monday | **Execution:** Every Wednesday

Not quarterly. Not semi-annually. **Weekly.**

## The Sector Concentration Problem

### SPLV: A Utilities Fund in Disguise

SPLV selects the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 based on trailing 12-month realized volatility. The result: extreme, unpredictable sector concentration.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SPLV in Utilities | 22% (vs. ~2.5% in S&P 500) |
| SPLV Top 3 Sectors | 53% |
| SPLV in Energy | 0% |
| THLV Max Sector Weight | 20% (Equal Weight) |

> "Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF normally protects against the downside well, but its lopsided sector composition can jeopardize its low-volatility objective."
> 
> — Ryan Jackson, Morningstar, April 2025

THLV holds sector ETFs at equal weight among all risk-on sectors — 10% each when all are active, up to a maximum of 20% when five remain. No single sector can dominate because the equal-weight architecture prevents it structurally.

## When It Matters Most: Crisis Performance

### March 2020 — The Low-Vol Stress Test

The COVID crash was the fastest 30%+ decline in market history — exactly the scenario low-volatility investors were paying for protection against.

| Fund | Peak-to-Trough Drawdown | Result |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| S&P 500 | −33.8% | Benchmark |
| **SPLV** | **−36.3%** | **Worse than the market** |
| **THLV Strategy** | **Cash-raising capability** | **Structural protection** |

SPLV fell **more than the broad market**. The reason: it was overweight utilities, REITs, and sectors hit disproportionately by the pandemic — and it had **no mechanism to reduce equity exposure**. Its mandate requires approximately 100% equity at all times.

### The Math of Drawdowns

Drawdown avoidance is the single most important driver of long-term compounding:

| Loss | Gain Required to Recover |
|------|--------------------------|
| −10% | +11.1% |
| −20% | +25.0% |
| −30% | +42.9% |
| **−36% (SPLV in 2020)** | **+56.3%** |
| −50% | +100.0% |

## Performance Comparison

### Calendar Year Returns

| Year | THLV | SPLV | S&P 500 |
|------|------|------|---------|
| **2026 YTD*** | **+5.49%** | +3.80% | +2.70% |
| **2025** | **+10.5%** | +4.1% | +15.4% |
| **2024** | +9.5% | +13.9% | +21.5% |
| **2023** | **+5.9%** | +0.5% | +22.3% |

*2026 YTD returns as of 02/03/2026. THLV return based on NAV.*

### Since THLV Inception (Sep 2022 – Dec 2025)

| Metric | THLV | SPLV |
|--------|------|------|
| Annualized Return | **~8.6%** | ~4.5% |
| Standard Deviation | **10.7%** | ~11.7% |
| Beta | 0.70 | 0.62 |

THLV outperformed SPLV by +5.4% in 2023 and +6.4% in 2025. In the strong bull market of 2024, THLV trailed — an expected trade-off for the structural protection the strategy provides when it matters most.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| | THLV | SPLV |
|--|------|------|
| Manager | THOR Financial Technologies | Invesco |
| Inception | Sep 2022 | May 2011 |
| Expense Ratio | 0.64% | 0.25% |
| Holdings | 10–12 sector ETFs | 103 stocks |
| Approach | Equal-weight sectors + cash capability | 100 lowest-vol S&P 500 stocks |
| Rebalancing | **Weekly** | Quarterly |
| Can Raise Cash | **✓ Up to 100%** | ✗ Must stay invested |
| Largest Sector Weight | **20% max** | 22% (Utilities) |
| Top 3 Sectors | **≤60% (balanced)** | 53% (concentrated) |
| COVID Drawdown | **Cash protection** | −36.3% |

### On the Expense Ratio

THLV's 0.64% reflects the cost of weekly rebalancing with active risk management. On a $500,000 portfolio, the fee differential versus SPLV is roughly $1,950 per year. SPLV's drawdown in March 2020 on that same portfolio was approximately $181,500. 

**The question isn't what the strategy costs — it's what it costs to go without it.**

## A Better Architecture for Low Volatility

SPLV concentrates risk in a handful of sectors and offers no ability to step aside when markets break down. THLV was built to solve both problems — equal weight across sectors, with a systematic move to cash when the evidence warrants it. 

For investors and advisors seeking genuine downside management alongside equity participation, the structural difference matters.
