# THOR Funds — Comprehensive Information

## Company Overview
THOR Funds is a family of exchange-traded funds managed by THOR Financial Technologies, LLC, founded by Brad Roth. Headquartered in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, THOR manages over $1.1 billion in assets using proprietary signal processing technology. The company serves registered investment advisors (RIAs) and their clients with systematic, rules-based investment strategies.

THOR's core philosophy: every other industry has embraced technology to improve outcomes — financial services should too. Traditional diversification techniques often fail to protect investors during sustained market downturns. THOR's systematic approach can move to 100% cash when conditions warrant, providing a level of downside protection most funds cannot offer.

## ETF Details

### THLV — THOR Equal Weight Low Volatility ETF
- **Strategy:** Trades S&P 500 sector ETFs with equal weighting across 10 sectors
- **How it works:** Proprietary signals evaluate each sector. When a sector signals risk-off, its allocation is redistributed to remaining risk-on sectors. As more sectors turn risk-off, the fund progressively raises cash in short-duration treasuries.
- **Key feature:** Can cascade from fully invested (10 sectors at 10% each) down to 100% short-duration treasuries
- **Rebalance:** Evaluation on Monday, execution on Wednesday
- **Strategic allocation:** 100% equity / 0% fixed income (with ability to move to 100% cash)

### THIR — THOR SDQ Index Rotation ETF
- **Strategy:** Rotates between S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq 100
- **How it works:** Starts equally weighted at 33.3% per index. When one index signals risk-off, remaining two reweight to 50% each. Second index off = 50% cash. Third off = 100% cash.
- **Key feature:** Systematic rotation overweights strongest-performing index while managing downside
- **AUM:** $150M+ (launched September 2024, backed by SMA track record since January 2020)

## Investment Philosophy
THOR believes that:
1. Lower volatility investing provides better long-term outcomes
2. The biggest drag on investor returns is behavioral — selling low, buying high, switching strategies at the wrong time
3. Rules-based systems eliminate emotional decision-making
4. The ability to raise cash is a critical risk management tool most funds lack
5. Technology and data analysis can identify regime changes before traditional methods

## What Makes THOR Different
- **Systematic approach:** All decisions are rules-based, removing emotional bias
- **Can go 100% cash:** Unlike most ETFs that must stay invested, THOR can move entirely to short-duration treasuries
- **Signal processing technology:** Proprietary methodology for detecting market regime changes
- **Downside focus:** Primary goal is reducing the drawdowns that compound into major return drag
- **Equal weight methodology:** Avoids concentration risk inherent in cap-weighted approaches

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What makes THOR ETFs different from other ETFs?**
A: THOR ETFs use proprietary signal processing technology to systematically manage risk. Unlike most ETFs that must stay invested regardless of market conditions, THOR funds can move to 100% cash when signals indicate sustained market stress.

**Q: Can THOR funds go to cash?**
A: Yes. Both THLV and THIR have the ability to move to 100% short-duration treasuries when market conditions warrant. This is a key differentiator — most ETFs cannot do this.

**Q: How does the index rotation strategy work?**
